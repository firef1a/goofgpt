Seven swabians were once together.  The first was master schulz, the second, jackli, the third, marli, the fourth, jergli, the fifth, michal, the sixth, Hans, the seventh, veitli.  All seven had made up their minds to travel about the world to seek adventures and perform great deeds.  But in order that they might go in safety and with arms in their hands, they thought it would be advisable that they should have one solitary, but very strong, and very long spear made for them.  This spear all seven of them took in their hands at once.  In front walked the boldest and bravest, and that was master schulz.  All the others followed in a row, and veitli was the last.  Then it came to pass one day in the hay month, when they had walked a long distance, and still had a long way to go before they reached the village where they were to pass the night, that as they were in a meadow in the twilight a great beetle or hornet flew by them from behind a bush, and hummed in a menacing manner.  Master schulz was so terrified that he all but dropped the spear, and a cold sweat broke out over his whole body. Hark, hark, cried he to his comrades, good heavens.  I hear a drum.  Jackli, who was behind him holding the spear, and into whose nose some smell had risen, said, something is most certainly going on, for I smell the powder and the match.  At these words master schulz began to take to flight, and in a trice jumped over a hedge, but as he just happened to jump on to the teeth of a rake which had been left lying there after the hay-making, the handle of it struck against his face and gave him a tremendous blow.  O dear.  O dear, screamed master schulz.  Take me prisoner, I surrender, I surrender.  The other six all leapt over, one on the top of the other, crying, if you surrender, I surrender too.  If you surrender, I surrender too.  At length, as no enemy was there to bind and take them away, they saw that they had been mistaken, and in order that the story might not be known, and they be treated as fools and ridiculed, they all swore to each other to hold their peace about it until one of them should speak of it by mistake. Then they journeyed onwards.  The second danger which they survived cannot be compared with the first.  Some days afterwards, their path led them through a fallow-field where a hare was sitting sleeping in the sun.  Her ears were standing straight up, and her great glassy eyes were wide open.  All of them were alarmed at the sight of the horrible wild beast, and they consulted together as to what it would be the least dangerous to do.  For if they were to run away, they knew that the monster would pursue and swallow them whole.  So they said, we must go through a great and dangerous struggle.  Boldly ventured, is half won, and all seven grasped the spear, master schulz in front, and veitli behind.  Master schulz was always trying to keep the spear back, but veitli had become quite brave while behind, and wanted to dash forward and cried,           strike home, in every swabian name,           or else I wish you may be lame. But Hans knew how to meet this, and said,           thunder and lightning, it fine to prate,           but for dragon-hunting you are always late. Michal cried,           nothing is missing, not even a hair,           be sure the devil himself is there. Then it was jergli turn, and he said,           if it be not he, it at least his mother,           or else the devil own step-brother. And now marli had a bright thought, and said to veitli,           advance, veitli, advance, advance,           and I behind will hold the lance. Veitli, however, did not obey, and jackli said,           tis schulz place the first to be,           no one deserves that honor but he. Then master schulz plucked up his courage, and said, gravely,           then let us boldly advance to the fight,           thus we shall show our valor and might. Hereupon they all together set on the dragon.  Master schulz crossed himself and prayed for God assistance, but as all this was of no avail, and he was getting nearer and nearer to the enemy, he screamed, oho, oho, ho, ho, ho, in the greatest anguish.  This awakened the hare, which in great alarm darted swiftly away.  When master schulz saw her thus flying from the field of battle, he cried in his joy,           quick, veitli, quick, look there, look there,           the monster nothing but a hare. But the swabian allies went in search of further adventures, and came to the moselle, a mossy, quiet, deep river, over which there are few bridges, and which in many places people have to cross in boats.  As the seven swabians did not know this, they called to a man who was working on the opposite side of the river, to know how people contrived to get across.  The distance and their way of speaking made the man unable to understand what they wanted, and he said, what, what, in the way people speak in the neighborhood of treves.  Master schulz thought he was saying, wade, wade through the water, and as he was the first, began to set out and went into the moselle.  It was not long before he sank in the mud and the deep waves which drove against him, but his hat was blown on the opposite shore by the wind, and a frog sat down beside it, and croaked, wat, wat, wat.  The other six on the opposite side heard that, and said, oho, comrades, master schulz is calling us.  If he can wade across, why cannot we. So they all jumped into the water together in a great hurry, and were drowned, and thus one frog took the lives of all six of them, and not one of the swabian allies ever reached home again. There were once upon a time a king and a queen who lived happily together and had twelve children, but they were all boys.  Then said the king to his wife, if the thirteenth child which you are about to bring into the world, is a girl, the twelve boys shall die, in order that her possessions may be great, and that the kingdom may fall to her alone.  He even caused twelve coffins to be made, which were already filled with shavings, and in each lay a little death pillow, and he had them taken into a locked-up room, and then he gave the queen the key of it, and bade her not to speak of this to anyone.  The mother, however, now sat and lamented all day long, until the youngest son, who was always with her, and whom she had named benjamin, from the bible, said to her, dear mother, why are you so sad.  Dearest child, she answered, I may not tell you.  But he let her have no rest until she went and unlocked the room, and showed him the twelve coffins ready filled with shavings.  Then she said, my dearest benjamin, your father has had these coffins made for you and for your eleven brothers, for if I bring a little girl into the world, you are all to be killed and buried in them.  And as she wept while she was saying this, the son comforted her and said, weep not, dear mother, we will save ourselves, and go hence.  But she said, go forth into the forest with your eleven brothers, and let one sit constantly on the highest tree which can be found, and keep watch, looking towards the tower here in the castle.  If I give birth to a little son, I will put up a white flag, and then you may venture to come back.  But if I bear a daughter, I will hoist a red flag, and then fly hence as quickly as you are able, and may the good God protect you.  And every night I will rise up and pray for you - in winter that you may be able to warm yourself at a fire, and in summer that you may not faint away in the heat.  After she had blessed her sons therefore, they went forth into the forest.  They each kept watch in turn, and sat on the highest oak and looked towards the tower.  When eleven days had passed and the turn came to benjamin, he saw that a flag was being raised. It was, however, not the white, but the blood-red flag which announced that they were all to die.  When the brothers heard that, they were very angry and said, are we all to suffer death for the sake of a girl.  We swear that we will avenge ourselves - wheresoever we find a girl, her red blood shall flow.  Thereupon they went deeper into the forest, and in the midst of it, where it was the darkest, they found a little bewitched hut, which was standing empty.  Then said they, here we will dwell, and you benjamin, who are the youngest and weakest, you shall stay at home and keep house, we others will go out and fetch food.  Then they went into the forest and shot hares, wild deer, birds and pigeons, and whatsoever there was to eat.  This they took to benjamin, who had to dress it for them in order that they might appease their hunger.  They lived together ten years in the little hut, and the time did not appear long to them.  The little daughter which their mother the queen had given birth to, was now grown up.  She was good of heart, and fair of face, and had a golden star on her forehead.  Once, on a great washing, she saw twelve men shirts among the things, and asked her mother, to whom do these twelve shirts belong, for they are far too small for father.  Then the queen answered with a heavy heart, dear child, these belong to your twelve brothers.  Said the maiden, where are my twelve brothers, I have never yet heard of them.  She replied, God knows where they are, they are wandering about the world.  Then she took the maiden and opened the chamber for her, and showed her the twelve coffins with the shavings, and the death pillows.  These coffins, said she, were destined for your brothers, who went away secretly before you were born, and she related to her how everything had happened. Then said the maiden, dear mother, weep not, I will go and seek my brothers.  So she took the twelve shirts and went forth, and straight into the great forest.  She walked the whole day, and in the evening she came to the bewitched hut.  Then she entered it and found a young boy, who asked, from whence do you come, and whither are you bound, and was astonished that she was so beautiful, and wore royal garments, and had a star on her forehead.  And she answered, I am a king daughter, and am seeking my twelve brothers, and I will walk as far as the sky is blue until I find them.  And she showed him the twelve shirts which belonged to them.  Then benjamin saw that she was his sister, and said, I am benjamin, your youngest brother.  And she began to weep for joy, and benjamin wept also, and they kissed and embraced each other with the greatest love.  But after this he said, dear sister, there is still one difficulty.  We have agreed that every maiden whom we meet shall die, because we have been obliged to leave our kingdom on account of a girl.  Then said she, I will willingly die, if by so doing I can save my twelve brothers.  No, answered he, you shall not die.  Seat yourself beneath this tub until our eleven brothers come, and then I will soon come to an agreement with them.  She did so, and when it was night the others came from hunting, and their dinner was ready.  And as they were sitting at table, and eating, they asked, what news is there.  Said benjamin, don;t you know anything.  No, they answered.  He continued, you have been in the forest and I have stayed at home, and yet I know more than you do.  Tell us then, they cried.  He answered, but promise me that the first maiden who meets us shall not be killed.  Yes, they all cried, she shall have mercy, only do tell us. Then said he, our sister is here, and he lifted up the tub, and the king daughter came forth in her royal garments with the golden star on her forehead, and she was beautiful, delicate and fair.  Then they were all rejoiced, and fell on her neck, and kissed and loved her with all their hearts.  Now she stayed at home with benjamin and helped him with the work.  The eleven went into the forest and caught game, and deer, and birds, and wood-pigeons that they might have food, and the little sister and benjamin took care to make it ready for them. She sought for the wood for cooking and herbs for vegetables, and put the pans on the fire so that the dinner was always ready when the eleven came.  She likewise kept order in the little house, and put beautifully white clean coverings on the little beds and the brothers were always contented and lived in great harmony with her.  Once upon a time the two at home had prepared a wonderful feast, and when they were all together, they sat down and ate and drank and were full of gladness.  There was, however, a little garden belonging to the bewitched house wherein stood twelve lily flowers, which are likewise called student-lilies.  She wished to give her brothers pleasure, and plucked the twelve flowers, and thought she would present each brother with one while at dinner. But at the self-same moment that she plucked the flowers the twelve brothers were changed into twelve ravens, and flew away over the forest, and the house and garden vanished likewise.  And now the poor maiden was alone in the wild forest, and when she looked around, an old woman was standing near her who said, my child, what have you done.  Why did you not leave the twelve white flowers growing.  They were your brothers, who are now forevermore changed into ravens.  The maiden said, weeping, is there no way of saving them.  No, said the woman, there is but one in the whole world, and that is so hard that you will not save them by it, for you must be dumb for seven years, and may not speak or laugh, and if you speak one single word, and only an hour of the seven years is wanting, all is in vain, and your brothers will be killed by the one word.  Then said the maiden in her heart, I know with certainty that I shall set my brothers free, and went and sought a high tree and seated herself in it and spun, and neither spoke nor laughed.  Now it so happened that a king was hunting in the forest, who had a great greyhound which ran to the tree on which the maiden was sitting, and sprang about it, whining, and barking at her.  Then the king came by and saw the beautiful king daughter with the golden star on her brow, and was so charmed with her beauty that he called to ask her if she would be his wife.  She made no answer, but nodded a little with her head.  So he climbed up the tree himself, carried her down, placed her on his horse, and bore her home.  Then the wedding was solemnized with great magnificence and rejoicing, but the bride neither spoke nor smiled.  When they had lived happily together for a few years, the king mother, who was a wicked woman, began to slander the young queen, and said to the king, this is a common beggar girl whom you have brought back with you.  Who knows what wicked tricks she practises secretly. Even if she be dumb, and not able to speak, she still might laugh for once.  But those who do not laugh have bad consciences.  At first the king would not believe it, but the old woman urged this so long, and accused her of so many evil things, that at last the king let himself be persuaded and sentenced her to death. And now a great fire was lighted in the courtyard in which she was to be burnt, and the king stood above at the window and looked on with tearful eyes, because he still loved her so much. And when she was bound fast to the stake, and the fire was licking at her clothes with its red tongue, the last instant of the seven years expired.  Then a whirring sound was heard in the air, and twelve ravens came flying towards the place, and sank downwards, and when they touched the earth they were her twelve brothers, whom she had saved.  They tore the fire asunder, extinguished the flames, set their dear sister free, and kissed and embraced her.  And now as she dared to open her mouth and speak, she told the king why she had been dumb, and had never laughed.  The king rejoiced when he heard that she was innocent, and they all lived in great unity until their death.  The wicked step-mother was taken before the judge, and put into a barrel filled with boiling oil and venomous snakes, and died an evil death. There was once on a time a soldier who for many years had served the king faithfully, but when the war came to an end could serve no longer because of the many wounds which he had received.  The king said to him, "You may return to your home, I need you no longer, and you will not receive any more money, for he only receives wages who renders me serve for them." Then the soldier did not know how to earn a living, went away greatly troubled, and walked the whole day, until in the evening he entered a forest.  When darkness came on, he saw a light, which he went up to, and came to a house wherein lived a witch.  "Do give me one night lodging, and a little to eat and drink," said he to her, "or I shall starve." "Oho," she answered, "who gives anything to a run-away soldier?  Yet will I be compassionate, and take you in, if you will do what I wish." "What do you wish?" said the soldier.  "That you should dig all round my garden for me, tomorrow." The soldier consented, and next day labored with all his strength, but could not finish it by the evening.  "I see well enough," said the witch, "that you can do no more today, but I will keep you yet another night, in payment for which you must tomorrow chop me a load of wood, and chop it small." The soldier spent the whole day in doing it, and in the evening the witch proposed that he should stay one night more.  "Tomorrow, you shall only do me a very trifling piece of work.  Behind my house, there is an old dry well, into which my light has fallen, it burns blue, and never goes out, and you shall bring it up again."  Next day the old woman took him to the well, and let him down in a basket.  He found the blue light, and made her a signal to draw him up again.  She did draw him up, but when he came near the edge, she stretched down her hand and wanted to take the blue light away from him.  "No," said he, perceiving her evil intention, "I will not give you the light until I am standing with both feet upon the ground." The witch fell into a passion, let him fall again into the well, and went away.  The poor soldier fell without injury on the moist ground, and the blue light went on burning, but of what use was that to him.  He saw very well that he could not escape death.  He sat for a while very sorrowfully, then suddenly he felt in his pocket and found his tobacco pipe, which was still half full.  "This shall be my last pleasure," thought he, pulled it out, lit it at the blue light and began to smoke.  When the smoke had circled about the cavern, suddenly a little black dwarf stood before him, and said, "Lord, what are your commands?" "What my commands are?" replied the soldier, quite astonished.  "I must do everything you bid me," said the little man. "Good," said the soldier, "then in the first place help me out of this well." The little man took him by the hand, and led him through an underground passage, but he did not forget to take the blue light with him.  On the way the dwarf showed him the treasures which the witch had collected and hidden there, and the soldier took as much gold as he could carry.  When he was above, he said to the little man, "Now go and bind the old witch, and carry her before the judge."  In a short time she came by like the wind, riding on a wild tom-cat and screaming frightfully.  Nor was it long before the little man re-appeared.  "It is all done," said he, "and the witch is already hanging on the gallows.  What further commands has my lord," inquired the dwarf.  "At this moment, none," answered the soldier, "You can return home, only be at hand immediately, if I summon you." "Nothing more is needed than that you should light your pipe at the blue light, and I will appear before you at once." Thereupon he vanished from his sight.  The soldier returned to the town from which he had come.  He went to the best inn, ordered himself handsome clothes, and then bade the landlord furnish him a room as handsome as possible. When it was ready and the soldier had taken possession of it, he summoned the little black mannikin and said, "I have served the king faithfully, but he has dismissed me, and left me to hunger, and now I want to take my revenge." "What am I to do?" asked the little man.  "Late at night, when the king daughter is in bed, bring her here in her sleep, she shall do servant work for me." The mannikin said, "That is an easy thing for me to do, but a very dangerous thing for you, for if it is discovered, you will fare ill." When twelve o;clock had struck, the door sprang open, and the mannikin carried in the princess.  "Aha, are you there?" cried the soldier, "Get to your work at once.  Fetch the broom and sweep the chamber." When she had done this, he ordered her to come to his chair, and then he stretched out his feet and said, "Pull off my boots," and then he threw them in her face, and made her pick them up again, and clean and brighten them. She, however, did everything he bade her, without opposition, silently and with half-shut eyes.  When the first chicken crowed, the mannikin carried her back to the royal palace, and laid her in her bed.  Next morning when the princess arose she went to her father, and told him that she had had a very strange dream.  "I was carried through the streets with the rapidity of lightning," said she, "and taken into a soldier room, and I had to wait upon him like a servant, sweep his room, clean his boots, and do all kinds of menial work.  It was only a dream, and yet I am just as tired as if I really had done everything." "The dream may have been true," said the king, "I will give you a piece of advice.  Fill your pocket full of peas, and make a small hole in the pocket, and then if you are carried away again, they will fall out and leave a track in the streets." But unseen by the king, the mannikin was standing beside him when he said that, and heard all.  At night when the sleeping princess was again carried through the streets, some peas certainly did fall out of her pocket, but they made no track, for the crafty mannikin had just before scattered peas in every street there was.  And again the princess was compelled to do servant work until chicken-crow.  Next morning the king sent his people out to seek the track, but it was all in vain, for in every street poor children were sitting, picking up peas, and saying, "It must have rained peas, last night." "We must think of something else," said the king, "keep your shoes on when you go to bed, and before you come back from the place where you are taken, hide one of them there, I will soon contrive to find it." The black mannikin heard this plot, and at night when the soldier again ordered him to bring the princess, revealed it to him, and told him that he knew of no expedient to counteract this stratagem, and that if the shoe were found in the soldier house it would go badly with him.  "Do what I bid you," replied the soldier, and again this third night the princess was obliged to work like a servant, but before she went away, she hid her shoe under the bed.  Next morning the king had the entire town searched for his daughter shoe.  It was found at the soldier, and the soldier himself, who at the entreaty of the dwarf had gone outside the gate, was soon brought back, and thrown into prison.  In his flight he had forgotten the most valuable things he had, the blue light and the gold, and had only one ducat in his pocket. And now loaded with chains, he was standing at the window of his dungeon, when he chanced to see one of his comrades passing by.  The soldier tapped at the pane of glass, and when this man came up, said to him, "Be so kind as to fetch me that small bundle I have lying in the inn, and I will give you a ducat for doing it."  His comrade ran thither and brought him what he wanted.  As soon as the soldier was alone again, he lighted his pipe and summoned the black mannikin.  "Have no fear," said the latter to his master.  "Go wheresoever they take you, and let them do what they will, only take the blue light with you." Next day the soldier was tried, and though he had done nothing wicked, the judge condemned him to death.  When he was led forth to die, he begged a last favor of the king.  "What is it?" asked the king.  "That I may smoke one more pipe on my way." "You may smoke three," answered the king, "but do not imagine that I will spare your life." Then the soldier pulled out his pipe and lighted it at the blue light, and as soon as a few wreaths of smoke had ascended, the mannikin was there with a small cudgel in his hand, and said, "What does my lord command?" "Strike down to earth that false judge there, and his constable, and spare not the king who has treated me so ill." Then the mannikin fell on them like lightning, darting this way and that way, and whosoever was so much as touched by his cudgel fell to earth, and did not venture to stir again.  The king was terrified, he threw himself on the soldier mercy, and merely to be allowed to live at all, gave him his kingdom for his own, and his daughter to wife. A certain man had a donkey, which had carried the corn-sacks to the mill indefatigably for many a long year.  But his strength was going, and he was growing more and more unfit for work.  Then his master began to consider how he might best save his keep.  But the donkey, seeing that no good wind was blowing, ran away and set out on the road to bremen.  There, he thought, I can surely be a town-musician.  When he had walked some distance, he found a hound lying on the road, gasping like one who had run till he was tired.  What are you gasping so for, you big fellow, asked the donkey. Ah, replied the hound, as I am old, and daily grow weaker, and no longer can hunt, my master wanted to kill me, so I took to flight, but now how am I to earn my bread. I tell you what, said the donkey, I am going to bremen, and shall be town-musician there.  Go with me and engage yourself also as a musician.  I will play the lute, and you shall beat the kettle-drum. The hound agreed, and on they went. Before long they came to a cat, sitting on the path, with a face like three rainy days.  Now then, old shaver, what has gone askew with you, asked the donkey. Who can be merry when his neck is in danger, answered the cat. Because I am now getting old, and my teeth are worn to stumps, and I prefer to sit by the fire and spin, rather than hunt about after mice, my mistress wanted to drown me, so I ran away.  But now good advice is scarce.  Where am I to go. Go with us to bremen.  You understand night-music, you can be a town-musician. The cat thought well of it, and went with them.  After this the three fugitives came to a farm-yard, where the chicken was sitting upon the gate, crowing with all his might.  Your crow goes through and through one, said the donkey.  What is the matter. I have been foretelling fine weather, because it is the day on which our lady washes the christ-child little shirts, and wants to dry them, said the chicken.  But guests are coming for sunday, so the housewife has no pity, and has told the cook that she intends to eat me in the soup to-morrow, and this evening I am to have my head cut off.  Now I am crowing at the top of my lungs while still I can. Ah, but red-comb, said the donkey, you had better come away with us.  We are going to bremen.  You can find something better than death everywhere.  You have a good voice, and if we make music together it must have some quality. The chicken agreed to this plan, and all four went on together. They could not reach the city of bremen in one day, however, and in the evening they came to a forest where they meant to pass the night.  The donkey and the hound laid themselves down under a large tree, the cat and the chicken settled themselves in the branches.  But the chicken flew right to the top, where he was most safe.  Before he went to sleep he looked round on all four sides, and thought he saw in the distance a little spark burning. So he called out to his companions that there must be a house not far off, for he saw a light.  The donkey said, if so, we had better get up and go on, for the shelter here is bad.  The hound thought too that a few bones with some meat on would do him good. So they made their way to the place where the light was, and soon saw it shine brighter and grow larger, until they came to a well-lighted robbers, house.  The donkey, as the biggest, went to the window and looked in. What do you see, my grey-horse, asked the chicken.  What do I see, answered the donkey.  A table covered with good things to eat and drink, and robbers sitting at it enjoying themselves. That would be the sort of thing for us, said the chicken.  Yes, yes.  Ah, if only we were there, said the donkey. Then the animals took counsel together how they should manage to drive away the robbers, and at last they thought of a plan. The donkey was to place himself with his fore-feet upon the window-ledge, the hound was to jump on the donkey back, the cat was to climb upon the dog, and lastly the chicken was to fly up and perch upon the head of the cat. When this was done, at a given signal, they began to perform their music together.  The donkey brayed, the hound barked, the cat mewed, and the chicken crowed.  Then they burst through the window into the room, shattering the glass.  At this horrible din, the robbers sprang up, thinking no otherwise than that a ghost had come in, and fled in a great fright out into the forest.  The four companions now sat down at the table, well content with what was left, and ate as if they were going to fast for a month. As soon as the four minstrels had done, they put out the light, and each sought for himself a sleeping-place according to his nature and what suited him.  The donkey laid himself down upon some straw in the yard, the hound behind the door, the cat upon the hearth near the warm ashes, and the chicken perched himself upon a beam of the roof.  And being tired from their long walk, they soon went to sleep. When it was past midnight, and the robbers saw from afar that the light was no longer burning in their house, and all appeared quiet, the captain said, we ought not to have let ourselves be frightened out of our wits, and ordered one of them to go and examine the house. The messenger finding all still, went into the kitchen to light a candle, and, taking the glistening fiery eyes of the cat for live coals, he held a lucifer-match to them to light it.  But the cat did not understand the joke, and flew in his face, spitting and scratching.  He was dreadfully frightened, and ran to the back-door, but the dog, who lay there sprang up and bit his leg.  And as he ran across the yard by the dunghill, the donkey gave him a smart kick with its hind foot.  The chicken, too, who had been awakened by the noise, and had become lively, cried down from the beam, chicken-a-doodle-doo. Then the robber ran back as fast as he could to his captain, and said, ah, there is a horrible witch sitting in the house, who spat on me and scratched my face with her long claws.  And by the door stands a man with a knife, who stabbed me in the leg. And in the yard there lies a black monster, who beat me with a wooden club.  And above, upon the roof, sits the judge, who called out, bring the rogue here to me.  So I got away as well as I could. After this the robbers never again dared enter the house. But it suited the four musicians of bremen so well that they did not care to leave it any more.  And the mouth of him who last told this story is still warm. Little brother took his little sister by the hand and said, since our mother died we have had no happiness.  Our step-mother beats us every day, and if we come near her she kicks us away with her foot.  Our meals are the hard crusts of bread that are left over.  And the little dog under the table is better off, for she often throws it a choice morsel.  God pity us, if our mother only knew.  Come, we will go forth together into the wide world.  They walked the whole day over meadows, fields, and stony places.  And when it rained the little sister said, heaven and our hearts are weeping together.  In the evening they came to a large forest, and they were so weary with sorrow and hunger and the long walk, that they lay down in a hollow tree and fell asleep. The next day when they awoke, the sun was already high in the sky, and shone down hot into the tree.  Then the brother said, sister, I am thirsty.  If I knew of a little brook I would go and just take a drink.  I think I hear one running.  The brother got up and took the little sister by the hand, and they set off to find the brook.  But the wicked step-mother was a witch, and had seen how the two children had gone away, and had crept after them secretly, as witches creep, and had bewitched all the brooks in the forest.  Now when they found a little brook leaping brightly over the stones, the brother was going to drink out of it, but the sister heard how it said as it ran, who drinks of me will be a tiger. Who drinks of me will be a tiger.  Then the sister cried, pray, dear brother, do not drink, or you will become a wild beast, and tear me to pieces.  The brother did not drink, although he was so thirsty, but said, I will wait for the next spring.  When they came to the next brook the sister heard this also say, who drinks of me will be a wolf.  Who drinks of me will be a wolf. Then the sister cried out, pray, dear brother, do not drink, or you will become a wolf, and devour me.  The brother did not drink, and said, I will wait until we come to the next spring, but then I must drink, say what you like.  For my thirst is too great. And when they came to the third brook the sister heard how it said as it ran, who drinks of me will be a roebuck.  Who drinks of me will be a roebuck.  The sister said, oh, I pray you, dear brother, do not drink, or you will become a roebuck, and run away from me.  But the brother had knelt down at once by the brook, and had bent down and drunk some of the water, and as soon as the first drops touched his lips he lay there in the form of a young roebuck.  And now the sister wept over her poor bewitched brother, and the little roe wept also, and sat sorrowfully near to her.  But at last the girl said, be quiet, dear little roe, I will never, never leave you.  Then she untied her golden garter and put it round the roebuck neck, and she plucked rushes and wove them into a soft cord.  This she tied to the little animal and led it on, and she walked deeper and deeper into the forest.  And when they had gone a very long way they came at last to a little house, and the girl looked in.  And as it was empty, she thought, we can stay here and live.  Then she sought for leaves and moss to make a soft bed for the roe.  And every morning she went out and gathered roots and berries and nuts for herself, and brought tender grass for the roe, who ate out of her hand, and was content and played round about her.  In the evening, when the sister was tired, and had said her prayer, she laid her head upon the roebuck back - that was her pillow, and she slept softly on it. And if only the brother had had his human form it would have been a delightful life. For some time they were alone like this in the wilderness.  But it happened that the king of the country held a great hunt in the forest.  Then the blasts of the horns, the barking of dogs and the merry shouts of the huntsmen rang through the trees, and the roebuck heard all, and was only too anxious to be there.  Oh, said he, to his sister, let me be off to the hunt, I cannot bear it any longer, and he begged so much that at last she agreed.  But, said she to him, come back to me in the evening.  I must shut my door for fear of the rough huntsmen, so knock and say, my little sister, let me in, that I may know you.  And if you do not say that, I shall not open the door.  Then the young roebuck sprang away.  So happy was he and so merry in the open air. The king and the huntsmen saw the lovely animal, and started after him, but they could not catch him, and when they thought that they surely had him, away he sprang through the bushes and vanished.  When it was dark he ran to the cottage, knocked, and said, my little sister, let me in.  Then the door was opened for him, and he jumped in, and rested himself the whole night through upon his soft bed. The next day the hunt began again, and when the roebuck once more heard the bugle-horn, and the ho. Ho. Of the huntsmen, he had no peace, but said, sister, let me out, I must be off.  His sister opened the door for him, and said, but you must be here again in the evening and say your pass-word. When the king and his huntsmen again saw the young roebuck with the golden collar, they all chased him, but he was too quick and nimble for them.  This lasted the whole day, but by the evening the huntsmen had surrounded him, and one of them wounded him a little in the foot, so that he limped and ran slowly.  Then a hunter crept after him to the cottage and heard how he said, my little sister, let me in, and saw that the door was opened for him, and was shut again at once.  The huntsman took notice of it all, and went to the king and told him what he had seen and heard.  Then the king said, to-morrow we will hunt once more. The little sister, however, was dreadfully frightened when she saw that her fawn was hurt.  She washed the blood off him, laid herbs on the wound, and said, go to your bed, dear roe, that you may get well again.  But the wound was so slight that the roebuck, next morning, did not feel it any more.  And when he again heard the sport outside, he said, I cannot bear it, I must be there. They shall not find it so easy to catch me.  The sister cried, and said, this time they will kill you, and here am I alone in the forest and forsaken by all the world.  I will not let you out.  Then you will have me die of grief, answered the roe.  When I hear the bugle-horns I feel as if I must jump out of my skin.  Then the sister could not do otherwise, but opened the door for him with a heavy heart, and the roebuck, full of health and joy, bounded into the forest. When the king saw him, he said to his huntsmen, now chase him all day long till night-fall, but take care that no one does him any harm. As soon as the sun had set, the king said to the huntsman, now come and show me the cottage in the wood.  And when he was at the door, he knocked and called out, dear little sister, let me in. Then the door opened, and the king walked in, and there stood a maiden more lovely than any he had ever seen.  The maiden was frightened when she saw, not her little roe, but a man come in who wore a golden crown upon his head.  But the king looked kindly at her, stretched out his hand, and said, will you go with me to my palace and be my dear wife.  Yes, indeed, answered the maiden, but the little roe must go with me, I cannot leave him. The king said, it shall stay with you as long as you live, and shall want nothing.  Just then he came running in, and the sister again tied him with the cord of rushes, took it in her own hand, and went away with the king from the cottage. The king took the lovely maiden upon his horse and carried her to his palace, where the wedding was held with great pomp. She was now the queen, and they lived for a long time happily together.  The roebuck was tended and cherished, and ran about in the palace-garden.  But the wicked step-mother, because of whom the children had gone out into the world, had never thought but that the sister had been torn to pieces by the wild beasts in the wood, and that the brother had been shot for a roebuck by the huntsmen.  Now when she heard that they were so happy, and so well off, envy and jealousy rose in her heart and left her no peace, and she thought of nothing but how she could bring them again to misfortune.  Her own daughter, who was ugly as night, and had only one eye, reproached her and said, a queen.  That ought to have been my luck.  Just be quiet, answered the old woman, and comforted her by saying, when the time comes I shall be ready. As time went on the queen had a pretty little boy, and it happened that the king was out hunting.  So the old witch took the form of the chamber maid, went into the room where the queen lay, and said to her, come the bath is ready.  It will do you good, and give you fresh strength.  Make haste before it gets cold. Her daughter also was close by.  So they carried the weakly queen into the bath-room, and put her into the bath.  Then they shut the door and ran away.  But in the bath-room they had made a fire of such hellish heat that the beautiful young queen was soon suffocated. When this was done the old woman took her daughter, put a nightcap on her head, and laid her in bed in place of the queen. She gave her too the shape and look of the queen, only she could not make good the lost eye.  But in order that the king might not see it, she was to lie on the side on which she had no eye. In the evening when he came home and heard that he had a son he was heartily glad, and was going to the bed of his dear wife to see how she was.  But the old woman quickly called out, for your life leave the curtains closed.  The queen ought not to see the light yet, and must have rest.  The king went away, and did not find out that a false queen was lying in the bed. But at midnight, when all slept, the nurse, who was sitting in the nursery by the cradle, and who was the only person awake, saw the door open and the true queen walk in.  She took the child out of the cradle, laid it on her arm, and suckled it.  Then she shook up its pillow, laid the child down again, and covered it with the little quilt.  And she did not forget the roebuck, but went into the corner where it lay, and stroked its back.  Then she went quite silently out of the door again.  The next morning the nurse asked the guards whether anyone had come into the palace during the night, but they answered, no, we have seen no one. She came thus many nights and never spoke a word.  The nurse always saw her, but she did not dare to tell anyone about it. When some time had passed in this manner, the queen began to speak in the night, and said,      how fares my child, how fares my roe.      Twice shall I come, then never more. The nurse did not answer, but when the queen had gone again, went to the king and told him all.   The king said, ah, God. What is this.  To-morrow night I will watch by the child.  In the evening he went into the nursery, and at midnight the queen again appeared and said,      how fares my child, how fares my roe.      Once will I come, then never more. And she nursed the child as she was wont to do before she disappeared.  The king dared not speak to her, but on the next night he watched again.  Then she said,      how fares my child, how fares my roe.      This time I come, then never more. Then the king could not restrain himself.  He sprang towards her, and said, you can be none other than my dear wife.  She answered, yes, I am your dear wife, and at the same moment she received life again, and by God grace became fresh, rosy and full of health. Then she told the king the evil deed which the wicked witch and her daughter had been guilty of towards her.  The king ordered both to be led before the judge, and the judgment was delivered against them.  The daughter was taken into the forest where she was torn to pieces by wild beasts, but the witch was cast into the fire and miserably burnt.  And as soon as she was burnt to ashes, the roebuck changed his shape, and received his human form again, so the sister and brother lived happily together all their lives. Cinderella The wife of a rich man fell sick, and as she felt that her end was drawing near, she called her only daughter to her bedside and said, dear child, be good and pious, and then the good God will always protect you, and I will look down on you from heaven and be near you.  Thereupon she closed her eyes and departed.  Every day the maiden went out to her mother grave, and wept, and she remained pious and good.  When winter came the snow spread a white sheet over the grave, and by the time the spring sun had drawn it off again, the man had taken another wife. The woman had brought with her into the house two daughters, who were beautiful and fair of face, but vile and black of heart. Now began a bad time for the poor step-child.  Is the stupid goose to sit in the parlor with us, they said.  He who wants to eat bread must earn it.  Out with the kitchen-wench.  They took her pretty clothes away from her, put an old grey bedgown on her, and gave her wooden shoes.  Just look at the proud princess, how decked out she is, they cried, and laughed, and led her into the kitchen. There she had to do hard work from morning till night, get up before daybreak, carry water, light fires, cook and wash.  Besides this, the sisters did her every imaginable injury - they mocked her and emptied her peas and lentils into the ashes, so that she was forced to sit and pick them out again.  In the evening when she had worked till she was weary she had no bed to go to, but had to sleep by the hearth in the cinders.  And as on that account she always looked dusty and dirty, they called her cinderella. It happened that the father was once going to the fair, and he asked his two step-daughters what he should bring back for them. Beautiful dresses, said one, pearls and jewels, said the second. And you, cinderella, said he, what will you have.  Father break off for me the first branch which knocks against your hat on your way home.  So he bought beautiful dresses, pearls and jewels for his two step-daughters, and on his way home, as he was riding through a green thicket, a hazel twig brushed against him and knocked off his hat.  Then he broke off the branch and took it with him.  When he reached home he gave his step-daughters the things which they had wished for, and to cinderella he gave the branch from the hazel-bush.  Cinderella thanked him, went to her mother grave and planted the branch on it, and wept so much that the tears fell down on it and watered it.  And it grew and became a handsome tree. Thrice a day cinderella went and sat beneath it, and wept and prayed, and a little white bird always came on the tree, and if cinderella expressed a wish, the bird threw down to her what she had wished for. It happened, however, that the king gave orders for a festival which was to last three days, and to which all the beautiful young girls in the country were invited, in order that his son might choose himself a bride.  When the two step-sisters heard that they too were to appear among the number, they were delighted, called cinderella and said, comb our hair for us, brush our shoes and fasten our buckles, for we are going to the wedding at the king palace. Cinderella obeyed, but wept, because she too would have liked to go with them to the dance, and begged her step-mother to allow her to do so.  You go, cinderella, said she, covered in dust and dirt as you are, and would go to the festival.  You have no clothes and shoes, and yet would dance.  As, however, cinderella went on asking, the step-mother said at last, I have emptied a dish of lentils into the ashes for you, if you have picked them out again in two hours, you shall go with us.  The maiden went through the back-door into the garden, and called, you tame pigeons, you turtle-doves, and all you birds beneath the sky, come and help me to pick      the good into the pot,      the bad into the crop. Then two white pigeons came in by the kitchen window, and afterwards the turtle-doves, and at last all the birds beneath the sky, came whirring and crowding in, and alighted amongst the ashes. And the pigeons nodded with their heads and began pick, pick, pick, pick, and the rest began also pick, pick, pick, pick, and gathered all the good grains into the dish.  Hardly had one hour passed before they had finished, and all flew out again.  Then the girl took the dish to her step-mother, and was glad, and believed that now she would be allowed to go with them to the festival. But the step-mother said, no, cinderella, you have no clothes and you can not dance.  You would only be laughed at.  And as cinderella wept at this, the step-mother said, if you can pick two dishes of lentils out of the ashes for me in one hour, you shall go with us.  And she thought to herself, that she most certainly cannot do again.  When the step-mother had emptied the two dishes of lentils amongst the ashes, the maiden went through the back-door into the garden and cried, you tame pigeons, you turtle-doves, and all you birds beneath the sky, come and help me to pick      the good into the pot,      the bad into the crop. Then two white pigeons came in by the kitchen-window, and afterwards the turtle-doves, and at length all the birds beneath the sky, came whirring and crowding in, and alighted amongst the ashes.  And the doves nodded with their heads and began pick, pick, pick, pick, and the others began also pick, pick, pick, pick, and gathered all the good seeds into the dishes, and before half an hour was over they had already finished, and all flew out again. Then the maiden was delighted, and believed that she might now go with them to the wedding.  But the step-mother said, all this will not help.  You cannot go with us, for you have no clothes and can not dance.  We should be ashamed of you.  On this she turned her back on cinderella, and hurried away with her two proud daughters. As no one was now at home, cinderella went to her mother grave beneath the hazel-tree, and cried -      shiver and quiver, little tree,      silver and gold throw down over me. Then the bird threw a gold and silver dress down to her, and slippers embroidered with silk and silver.  She put on the dress with all speed, and went to the wedding.  Her step-sisters and the step-mother however did not know her, and thought she must be a foreign princess, for she looked so beautiful in the golden dress. They never once thought of cinderella, and believed that she was sitting at home in the dirt, picking lentils out of the ashes.  The prince approached her, took her by the hand and danced with her. He would dance with no other maiden, and never let loose of her hand, and if any one else came to invite her, he said, this is my partner. She danced till it was evening, and then she wanted to go home. But the king son said, I will go with you and bear you company, for he wished to see to whom the beautiful maiden belonged. She escaped from him, however, and sprang into the pigeon-house.  The king son waited until her father came, and then he told him that the unknown maiden had leapt into the pigeon-house.  The old man thought, can it be cinderella.  And they had to bring him an axe and a pickaxe that he might hew the pigeon-house to pieces, but no one was inside it.  And when they got home cinderella lay in her dirty clothes among the ashes, and a dim little oil-lamp was burning on the mantle-piece, for cinderella had jumped quickly down from the back of the pigeon-house and had run to the little hazel-tree, and there she had taken off her beautiful clothes and laid them on the grave, and the bird had taken them away again, and then she had seated herself in the kitchen amongst the ashes in her grey gown. Next day when the festival began afresh, and her parents and the step-sisters had gone once more, cinderella went to the hazel-tree and said -      shiver and quiver, my little tree,      silver and gold throw down over me. Then the bird threw down a much more beautiful dress than on the preceding day. And when cinderella appeared at the wedding in this dress, every one was astonished at her beauty.  The king son had waited until she came, and instantly took her by the hand and danced with no one but her.  When others came and invited her, he said, this is my partner.  When evening came she wished to leave, and the king son followed her and wanted to see into which house she went.  But she sprang away from him, and into the garden behind the house.  Therein stood a beautiful tall tree on which hung the most magnificent pears.  She clambered so nimbly between the branches like a squirrel that the king son did not know where she was gone.  He waited until her father came, and said to him, the unknown maiden has escaped from me, and I believe she has climbed up the pear-tree.  The father thought, can it be cinderella.  And had an axe brought and cut the tree down, but no one was on it.  And when they got into the kitchen, cinderella lay there among the ashes, as usual, for she had jumped down on the other side of the tree, had taken the beautiful dress to the bird on the little hazel-tree, and put on her grey gown. On the third day, when the parents and sisters had gone away, cinderella went once more to her mother grave and said to the little tree -      shiver and quiver, my little tree,      silver and gold throw down over me. And now the bird threw down to her a dress which was more splendid and magnificent than any she had yet had, and the slippers were golden.  And when she went to the festival in the dress, no one knew how to speak for astonishment.  The king son danced with her only, and if any one invited her to dance, he said this is my partner. When evening came, cinderella wished to leave, and the king son was anxious to go with her, but she escaped from him so quickly that he could not follow her.  The king son, however, had employed a ruse, and had caused the whole staircase to be smeared with pitch, and there, when she ran down, had the maiden left slipper remained stuck.  The king son picked it up, and it was small and dainty, and all golden.  Next morning, he went with it to the father, and said to him, no one shall be my wife but she whose foot this golden slipper fits.  Then were the two sisters glad, for they had pretty feet.  The eldest went with the shoe into her room and wanted to try it on, and her mother stood by.  But she could not get her big toe into it, and the shoe was too small for her.  Then her mother gave her a knife and said, cut the toe off, when you are queen you will have no more need to go on foot.  The maiden cut the toe off, forced the foot into the shoe, swallowed the pain, and went out to the king son.  Then he took her on his his horse as his bride and rode away with her.  They were obliged, however, to pass the grave, and there, on the hazel-tree, sat the two pigeons and cried -      turn and peep, turn and peep,      there blood within the shoe,      the shoe it is too small for her,      the true bride waits for you. Then he looked at her foot and saw how the blood was trickling from it.  He turned his horse round and took the false bride home again, and said she was not the true one, and that the other sister was to put the shoe on.  Then this one went into her chamber and got her toes safely into the shoe, but her heel was too large.  So her mother gave her a knife and said,  cut a bit off your heel, when you are queen you will have no more need to go on foot.  The maiden cut a bit off her heel, forced her foot into the shoe, swallowed the pain, and went out to the king son.  He took her on his horse as his bride, and rode away with her, but when they passed by the hazel-tree, the two pigeons sat on it and cried -      turn and peep, turn and peep,      there blood within the shoe,      the shoe it is too small for her,      the true bride waits for you. He looked down at her foot and saw how the blood was running out of her shoe, and how it had stained her white stocking quite red.  Then he turned his horse and took the false bride home again.  This also is not the right one, said he, have you no other daughter.  No, said the man, there is still a little stunted kitchen-wench which my late wife left behind her, but she cannot possibly be the bride.  The king son said he was to send her up to him, but the mother answered, oh, no, she is much too dirty, she cannot show herself.  But he absolutely insisted on it, and cinderella had to be called.  She first washed her hands and face clean, and then went and bowed down before the king son, who gave her the golden shoe.  Then she seated herself on a stool, drew her foot out of the heavy wooden shoe, and put it into the slipper, which fitted like a glove.  And when she rose up and the king son looked at her face he recognized the beautiful maiden who had danced with him and cried, that is the true bride.  The step-mother and the two sisters were horrified and became pale with rage, he, however, took cinderella on his horse and rode away with her.  As they passed by the hazel-tree, the two white doves cried -      turn and peep, turn and peep,      no blood is in the shoe,      the shoe is not too small for her,      the true bride rides with you, and when they had cried that, the two came flying down and placed themselves on cinderella shoulders, one on the right, the other on the left, and remained sitting there. When the wedding with the king son was to be celebrated, the two false sisters came and wanted to get into favor with cinderella and share her good fortune.  When the betrothed couple went to church, the elder was at the right side and the younger at the left, and the pigeons pecked out one eye from each of them.  Afterwards as they came back the elder was at the left, and the younger at the right, and then the pigeons pecked out the other eye from each.  And thus, for their wickedness and falsehood, they were punished with blindness all their days. There was once a man who had a daughter who was called clever elsie.  And when she had grown up her father said, we will get her married.  Yes, said the mother, if only someone would come who would have her.  At length a man came from a distance and wooed her, who was called Hans, but he stipulated that clever elsie should be really smart.  Oh, said the father, she has plenty of good sense.  And the mother said, oh, she can see the wind coming up the street, and hear the flies coughing.  Well, said Hans, if she is not really smart, I won;t have her. When they were sitting at dinner and had eaten, the mother said, elsie, go into the cellar and fetch some beer.  Then clever elsie took the pitcher from the wall, went into the cellar, and tapped the lid briskly as she went, so that the time might not appear long.  When she was below she fetched herself a chair, and set it before the barrel so that she had no need to stoop, and did not hurt her back or do herself any unexpected injury.  Then she placed the can before her, and turned the tap, and while the beer was running she would not let her eyes be idle, but looked up at the wall, and after much peering here and there, saw a pick-axe exactly above her, which the masons had accidentally left there.  Then clever elsie began to weep, and said, if I get Hans, and we have a child, and he grows big, and we send him into the cellar here to draw beer, then the pick-axe will fall on his head and kill him.  Then she sat and wept and screamed with all the strength of her body, over the misfortune which lay before her.  Those upstairs waited for the drink, but clever elsie still did not come.  Then the woman said to the servant, just go down into the cellar and see where elsie is.  The maid went and found her sitting in front of the barrel, screaming loudly.  Elsie, why do you weep, asked the maid.  Ah, she answered, have I not reason to weep.  If I get Hans, and we have a child, and he grows big, and has to draw beer here, the pick-axe will perhaps fall on his head, and kill him.  Then said the maid, what a clever elsie we have.  And sat down beside her and began loudly to weep over the misfortune.  After a while, as the maid did not come back, those upstairs were thirsty for the beer, the man said to the boy, just go down into the cellar and see where elsie and the girl are.  The boy went down, and there sat clever elsie and the girl both weeping together.  Then he asked, why are you weeping,  ah, said elsie, have I not reason to weep.  If I get Hans, and we have a child, and he grows big, and has to draw beer here, the pick-axe will fall on his head and kill him.  Then said the boy, what a clever elsie we have.  And sat down by her, and likewise began to howl loudly.  Upstairs they waited for the boy, but as he still did not return, the man said to the woman, just go down into the cellar and see where elsie is.  The woman went down, and found all three in the midst of their lamentations, and inquired what was the cause, then elsie told her also that her future child was to be killed by the pick-axe, when it grew big and had to draw beer, and the pick-axe fell down.  Then said the mother likewise, what a clever elsie we have. And sat down and wept with them.  The man upstairs waited a short time, but as his wife did not come back and his thirst grew ever greater, he said, I must go into the cellar myself and see where elsie is.  But when he got into the cellar, and they were all sitting together crying, and he heard the reason, and that elsie child was the cause, and that elsie might perhaps bring one into the world some day, and that he might be killed by the pick-axe, if he should happen to be sitting beneath it, drawing beer just at the very time when it fell down, he cried, oh, what a clever elsie.  And sat down, and likewise wept with them.  The bridegroom stayed upstairs alone for a long time, then as no one would come back he thought, they must be waiting for me below, I too must go there and see what they are about.  When he got down, the five of them were sitting screaming and lamenting quite piteously, each out-doing the other.  What misfortune has happened then, he asked.  Ah, dear Hans, said elsie, if we marry each other and have a child, and he is big, and we perhaps send him here to draw something to drink, then the pick-axe which has been left up there might dash his brains out if it were to fall down, so have we not reason to weep.  Come, said Hans, more understanding than that is not needed for my household, as you are such a clever elsie, I will have you.  And he seized her hand, took her upstairs with him, and married her.  After Hans had had her some time, he said, wife, I am going out to work and earn some money for us, go into the field and cut the corn that we may have some bread.  Yes, dear Hans, I will do that.  After Hans had gone away, she cooked herself some good broth and took it into the field with her.  When she came to the field she said to herself, what shall I do, shall I cut first, or shall I eat first.  Oh, I will eat first.  Then she drank her cup of broth, and when she was fully satisfied, she once more said, what shall I do.  Shall I cut first, or shall I sleep first.  I will sleep first.  Then she lay down among the corn and fell asleep.  Hans had been at home for a long time, but elsie did not come, then said he, what a clever elsie I have, she is so industrious that she does not even come home to eat.  But when evening came and she still stayed away, Hans went out to see what she had cut, but nothing was cut, and she was lying among the corn asleep.  Then Hans hastened home and brought a fowler net with little bells and hung it round about her, and she still went on sleeping.  Then he ran home, shut the house-door, and sat down in his chair and worked.  At length, when it was quite dark, clever elsie awoke and when she got up there was a jingling all round about her, and the bells rang at each step which she took. Then she was alarmed, and became uncertain whether she really was clever elsie or not, and said, is it I, or is it not I.  But she knew not what answer to make to this, and stood for a time in doubt, at length she thought, I will go home and ask if it be I, or if it be not I, they will be sure to know.  She ran to the door of her own house, but it was shut, then she knocked at the window and cried, Hans, is elsie within.  Yes, answered Hans, she is within.  Hereupon she was terrified, and said, ah, heavens. Then it is not I.  And went to another door, but when the people heard the jingling of the bells they would not open it, and she could get in nowhere.  Then she ran out of the village, and no one has seen her since. The mother of Hans said, whither away, Hans.  Hans answered, to Gretel.  Behave well, Hans.  Oh, I;ll behave well.  Good-bye, mother.  Good-bye, Hans.  Hans comes to Gretel.  Good day, Gretel. Good day, Hans.  What do you bring that is good.  I bring nothing, I want to have something given me.  Gretel presents Hans with a needle.  Hans says, good-bye, Gretel.  Good-bye, Hans. Hans takes the needle, sticks it into a hay-cart, and follows the cart home.  Good evening, mother.  Good evening, Hans.  Where have you been.  With Gretel.  What did you take her.  Took her nothing, had something given me.  What did Gretel give you.  Gave me a needle.  Where is the needle, Hans.  Stuck it in the hay-cart. That was ill done, Hans.  You should have stuck the needle in your sleeve.  Never mind, I;ll do better next time.  Whither away, Hans.  To Gretel, mother.  Behave well, Hans. Oh, I;ll behave well.  Good-bye, mother.  Good-bye, Hans.  Hans comes to Gretel.  Good day, Gretel.  Good day, Hans.  What do you bring that is good.  I bring nothing, I want to have something given to me.  Gretel presents Hans with a knife.  Good-bye, Gretel. Good-bye Hans.  Hans takes the knife, sticks it in his sleeve, and goes home.  Good evening, mother.  Good evening, Hans.  Where have you been.  With Gretel.  What did you take her.  Took her nothing, she gave me something.  What did Gretel give you.  Gave me a knife.  Where is the knife, Hans.  Stuck in my sleeve. That ill done, Hans, you should have put the knife in your pocket.  Never mind, will do better next time.  Whither away, Hans.  To Gretel, mother.  Behave well, Hans. Oh, I;ll behave well.  Good-bye, mother.  Good-bye, Hans.  Hans comes to Gretel.  Good day, Gretel.  Good day, Hans.  What good thing do you bring.  I bring nothing, I want something given me. Gretel presents Hans with a young goat.  Good-bye, Gretel. Good-bye, Hans.  Hans takes the goat, ties its legs, and puts it in his pocket.  When he gets home it is suffocated.  Good evening, mother.  Good evening, Hans.  Where have you been.  With Gretel. What did you take her.  Took nothing, she gave me something.  What did Gretel give you.  She gave me a goat.  Where is the goat, Hans. Put it in my pocket.  That was ill done, Hans, you should have put a rope round the goat neck.  Never mind, will do better next time.  Whither away, Hans,  to Gretel, mother.  Behave well, Hans. Oh, I;ll behave well good-bye, mother.  Good-bye, Hans.  Hans comes to Gretel.  Good day, Gretel.  Good day, Hans.  What good thing do you bring.  I bring nothing, I want something given to me.  Gretel presents Hans with a piece of bacon.  Good-bye, Gretel.  Good-bye, Hans. Hans takes the bacon, ties it to a rope, and drags it away behind him.  The dogs come and devour the bacon.  When he gets home, he has the rope in his hand, and there is no longer anything hanging to it.  Good evening, mother.  Good evening, Hans.  Where have you been.  With Gretel.  What did you take her.  I took her nothing, she gave me something.  What did Gretel give you. Gave me a bit of bacon.  Where is the bacon, Hans.  I tied it to a rope, brought it home, dogs took it.  That was ill done, Hans, you should have carried the bacon on your head.  Never mind, will do better next time.  Whither away, Hans.  To Gretel, mother.  Behave well, Hans. I;ll behave well.  Good-bye, mother.  Good-bye, Hans.  Hans comes to Gretel.  Good day, Gretel.  Good day, Hans.  What good thing do you bring.  I bring nothing, but would have something given.  Gretel presents Hans with a calf.  Good-bye, Gretel. Good-bye, Hans. Hans takes the calf, puts it on his head, and the calf kicks his face.  Good evening, mother.  Good evening, Hans.  Where have you been.  With Gretel.  What did you take her.  I took nothing, but had something given me.  What did Gretel give you.  A calf. Where have you the calf, Hans.  I set it on my head and it kicked my face.  That was ill done, Hans, you should have led the calf, and put it in the stall.  Never mind, will do better next time.  Whither away, Hans.  To Gretel, mother.  Behave well, Hans. I;ll behave well.  Good-bye, mother.  Good-bye, Hans. Hans comes to Gretel.  Good day, Gretel.  Good day, Hans.  What good thing do you bring.  I bring nothing, but would have something given.  Gretel says to Hans, I will go with you. Hans takes Gretel, ties her to a rope, leads her to the rack and binds her fast.  Then Hans goes to his mother.  Good evening, mother.  Good evening, Hans.  Where have you been.  With Gretel. What did you take her.  I took her nothing.  What did Gretel give you.  She gave me nothing, she came with me.  Where have you left Gretel.  I led her by the rope, tied her to the rack, and scattered some grass for her.  That was ill done, Hans, you should have cast friendly eyes on her.  Never mind, will do better.  Hans went into the stable, cut out all the calves, and sheep eyes, and threw them in Gretel face.  Then Gretel became angry, tore herself loose and ran away, and was no longer the bride of Hans. Let no one ever say that a poor tailor cannot do great things and win high honors.  All that is needed is that he should go to the right smithy, and what is of most consequence, that he should have good luck.  A civil, smart tailor apprentice once went out traveling, and came into a great forest, and, as he did not know the way, he lost himself.  Night fell and nothing was left for him to do in this painful solitude, but to seek a bed.  He might certainly have found a good bed on the soft moss, but the fear of wild beasts let him have no rest there, and at last he made up his mind to spend the night in a tree.  He sought out a high oak, climbed up to the top of it, and thanked God that he had his goose with him, for otherwise the wind which blew over the top of the tree would have carried him away. After he had spent some hours in the darkness, not without fear and trembling, he saw at a very short distance the glimmer of a light, and as he thought that a human habitation might be there, where he would be better off than on the branches of a tree, he got carefully down and went towards the light.  It guided him to a small hut that was woven together of reeds and rushes.  He knocked boldly, the door opened, and by the light which came forth he saw a little hoary old man who wore a coat made of bits of colored stuff sewn together.  Who are you, and what do you want, asked the man in a grumbling voice.  I am a poor tailor, he answered, whom night has surprised here in the wilderness, and I earnestly beg you to take me into your hut until morning.  Go your way, replied the old man in a surly voice, I will have nothing to do with tramps, seek for yourself a shelter elsewhere.  Having said this, he was about to slip into his hut again, but the tailor held him so tightly by the corner of his coat, and pleaded so piteously, that the old man, who was not so ill-natured as he wished to appear, was at last softened, and took him into the hut with him where he gave him something to eat, and then offered him a very good bed in a corner. The weary tailor needed no rocking, but slept sweetly till morning, but even then would not have thought of getting up, if he had not been aroused by a great noise.  A violent sound of screaming and roaring forced its way through the thin walls of the hut. The tailor, full of unwonted courage, jumped up, put his clothes on in haste, and hurried out.  Then close by the hut, he saw a great black bull and a beautiful stag, which were just preparing for a violent struggle.  They rushed at each other with such extreme rage that the ground shook with their trampling, and the air resounded with their cries.  For a long time it was uncertain which of the two would gain the victory, at length the stag thrust his horns into his adversary body, whereupon the bull fell to the earth with a terrific roar, and was finished off by a few strokes from the stag. The tailor, who had watched the fight with astonishment, was still standing there motionless, when the stag in full career bounded up to him, and before he could escape, caught him up on his great horns.  He had not much time to collect his thoughts, for it went in a swift race over stock and stone, mountain and valley, wood and meadow.  He held with both hands to the ends of the horns, and resigned himself to his fate.  It seemed to him just as if he were flying away.  At length the stag stopped in front of a wall of rock, and gently let the tailor down.  The tailor, more dead than alive, required some time to come to himself.  When he had in some degree recovered, the stag, which had remained standing by him, pushed its horns with such force against a door in the rock, that it sprang open.  Flames of fire shot forth, after which followed a great smoke, which hid the stag from his sight.  The tailor did not know what to do, or whither to turn, in order to get out of this desert and back to human beings again.  Whilst he was standing thus undecided, a voice sounded out of the rock, which cried to him, enter without fear, no evil shall befall you. He hesitated, but driven by a mysterious force, he obeyed the voice and went through the iron-door into a large spacious hall, whose ceiling, walls and floor were made of shining polished square stones, on each of which were carved signs which were unknown to him.  He looked at everything full of admiration, and was on the point of going out again, when he once more heard the voice which said to him, step on the stone which lies in the middle of the hall, and great good fortune awaits you. His courage had already grown so great that he obeyed the order. The stone began to give way under his feet, and sank slowly down into the depths.  When it was once more firm, and the tailor looked round, he found himself in a hall which in size resembled the former.  Here, however, there was more to look at and to admire. Hollow places were cut in the walls, in which stood vases of transparent glass and filled with colored spirit or with a bluish vapor.  On the floor of the hall two great glass chests stood opposite to each other, which at once excited his curiosity. When he went to one of them he saw inside it a handsome structure like a castle surrounded by farm-buildings, stables and barns, and a quantity of other good things.  Everything was small, but exceedingly carefully and delicately made, and seemed to be carved out by a dexterous hand with the greatest precision. He might not have turned away his eyes from the consideration of this rarity for some time, had not the voice once more made itself heard.  It ordered him to turn round and look at the glass chest which was standing opposite.  How his admiration increased when he saw therein a maiden of the greatest beauty.  She lay as if asleep, and was wrapped in her long fair hair as in a precious mantle.  Her eyes were closely shut, but the brightness of her complexion and a ribbon which her breathing moved to and fro, left no doubt that she was alive.  The tailor was looking at the beauty with beating heart, when she suddenly opened her eyes, and started up at the sight of him with a shock of joy.  Divine providence, cried she, my deliverance is at hand.  Quick, quick, help me out of my prison.  If you push back the bolt of this glass coffin, then I shall be free. The tailor obeyed without delay, and she immediately raised up the glass lid, came out and hastened into the corner of the hall, where she covered herself with a large cloak.  Then she seated herself on a stone, ordered the young man to come to her, and after she had imprinted a friendly kiss on his lips, she said, my long-desired deliverer, kind heaven has guided you to me, and put an end to my sorrows.  On the self-same day when they end, shall your happiness begin.  You are the husband chosen for me by heaven, and shall pass your life in unbroken joy, loved by me, and rich to overflowing in every earthly possession.  Seat yourself, and listen to the story of my life. I am the daughter of a rich count.  My parents died when I was still in my tender youth, and recommended me in their last will to my elder brother, by whom I was brought up.  We loved each other so tenderly, and were so alike in our way of thinking and our inclinations, that we both embraced the resolution never to marry, but to stay together to the end of our lives. In our house there was no lack of company.  Neighbors and friends visited us often, and we showed the greatest hospitality to every one.  So it came to pass one evening that a stranger came riding to our castle, and, under pretext of not being able to get on to the next place, begged for shelter for the night. We granted his request with ready courtesy, and he entertained us in the most agreeable manner during supper by conversation intermingled with stories.  My brother liked the stranger so much that he begged him to spend a couple of days with us, to which, after some hesitation, he consented.  We did not rise from table until late in the night, the stranger was shown to a room, and I hastened, as I was tired, to lay my limbs in my soft bed.  Hardly had I fallen off to sleep, when the sound of faint and delightful music awoke me.  As I could not conceive from whence it came, I wanted to summon my waiting-maid who slept in the next room, but to my astonishment I found that speech was taken away from me by an unknown force.  I felt as if a nightmare were weighing down my breast, and was unable to make the very slightest sound.  In the meantime, by the light of my night-lamp, I saw the stranger enter my room through two doors which were fast bolted.  He came to me and said, that by magic arts which were at his command, he had caused the lovely music to sound in order to awaken me, and that he now forced his way through all fastenings with the intention of offering his hand and heart.  My dislike of his magic arts was so great, however, that I refused to answer him. He remained for a time standing without moving, apparently with the idea of waiting for a favorable decision, but as I continued to keep silence, he angrily declared he would revenge himself and find means to punish my pride, and left the room.  I passed the night in the greatest disquietude, and fell asleep only towards morning.  When I awoke, I hurried to my brother, but did not find him in his room, and the attendants told me that he had ridden forth with the stranger to the chase at daybreak.  I at once suspected nothing good.  I dressed myself quickly, ordered my palfrey to be saddled, and accompanied only by one servant, rode full gallop to the forest.  The servant fell with his horse, and could not follow me, for the horse had broken its foot.  I pursued my way without halting, and in a few minutes I saw the stranger coming towards me with a beautiful stag which he led by a cord.  I asked him where he had left my brother, and how he had come by this stag, out of whose great eyes I saw tears flowing.  Instead of answering me, he began to laugh loudly.  I fell into a great rage at this, pulled out a pistol and discharged it at the monster, but the ball rebounded from his breast and went into my horse head.  I fell to the ground, and the stranger muttered some words which deprived me of consciousness. When I came to my senses again I found myself in this underground cave in a glass coffin.  The magician appeared once again, and said he had changed my brother into a stag, my castle with all that belonged to it, diminished in size by his arts, he had shut up in the other glass chest, and my people, who were all turned into smoke, he had confined in glass bottles.  He told me that if I would now comply with his wish, it would be an easy thing for him to put everything back in its former state, as he had nothing to do but open the vessels, and everything would return once more to its natural form.  I answered him as little as I had done the first time.  He vanished and left me in my prison, in which a deep sleep came on me. Among the visions which passed before my eyes, the most comforting was that in which a young man came and set me free, and when I opened my eyes to-day I saw you, and beheld my dream fulfilled.  Help me to accomplish the other things which happened in those visions.  The first is that we lift the glass chest in which my castle is enclosed, on to that broad stone. As soon as the stone was laden, it began to rise up on high with the maiden and the young man, and mounted through the opening of the ceiling into the upper hall, from whence they then could easily reach the open air.  Here the maiden opened the lid, and it was marvellous to behold how the castle, the houses, and the farm buildings which were enclosed, stretched themselves out and grew to their natural size with the greatest rapidity. After this, the maiden and the tailor returned to the cave beneath the earth, and had the vessels which were filled with smoke carried up by the stone.  The maiden had scarcely opened the bottles when the blue smoke rushed out and changed itself into living men, in whom she recognized her servants and her people. Her joy was still more increased when her brother, who had killed the magician in the form of the bull, came out of the forest towards them in his human form, and on the self-same day the maiden, in accordance with her promise, gave her hand at the altar to the lucky tailor. There was once a peasant who had driven his cow to the fair, and sold her for seven talers.  On the way home he had to pass a pond, and already from afar he heard the frogs crying, aik, aik, aik, aik. Well, said he to himself, they are talking without rhyme or reason, it is seven that I have received, not eight. When he got to the water, he cried to them, stupid animals that you are.  Don;t you know better than that.  It is seven thalers and not eight.  The frogs, however, stuck to their, aik aik, aik, aik.  Come, then, if you won;t believe it, I can count it out to you.  And he took his money out of his pocket and counted out the seven talers, always reckoning four and twenty groschen to a taler.  The frogs, however, paid no attention to his reckoning, but still cried, aik, aik, aik, aik. What, cried the peasant, quite angry, if you know better than I, count it yourselves, and threw all the money at them into the water. He stood still and wanted to wait until they were through and had returned to him what was his, but the frogs maintained their opinion and cried continually, aik, aik, aik, aik.  And besides that, did not throw the money out again.  He still waited a long while until evening came on and he was forced to go home. Then he abused the frogs and cried, you water-splashers, you thick-heads, you goggle-eyes, you have great mouths and can screech till you hurt one ears, but you cannot count seven talers.  Do you think I;m going to stand here till you get through.  And with that he went away, but the frogs still cried, aik, aik, aik, aik, after him till he went home sorely vexed. After a while he bought another cow, which he slaughtered, and he made the calculation that if he sold the meat well he might gain as much as the two cows were worth, and have the hide into the bargain.  When therefore he got to the town with the meat, a great pack of dogs were gathered together in front of the gate, with a large greyhound at the head of them, which jumped at the meat, sniffed at it, and barked, wow, wow, wow.  As there was no stopping him, the peasant said to him, yes, yes, I know quite well that you are saying wow, wow, wow, because you want some of the meat, but I should be in a fine state if I were to give it to you.  The dog, however, answered nothing but wow, wow.  Will you promise not to devour it all then, and will you go bail for your companions.  Wow, wow, wow, said the dog.  Well, if you insist on it, I will leave it for you, I know you well, and know whom you serve, but this I tell you, I must have my money in three days or else it will go ill with you, you can just bring it out to me.  Thereupon he unloaded the meat and turned back again.  The dogs fell upon it and loudly barked, wow, wow. The countryman, who heard them from afar, said to himself, hark, now they all want some, but the big one is responsible to me for it. When three days had passed, the countryman thought, to-night my money will be in my pocket, and was quite delighted.  But no one would come and pay it.  There is no trusting any one now, said he. At last he lost patience, and went into the town to the butcher and demanded his money.  The butcher thought it was a joke, but the peasant said, jesting apart, I will have my money.  Did not the big dog bring you the whole of the slaughtered cow three days ago.  Then the butcher grew angry, snatched a broomstick and drove him out.  Wait, said the peasant, there is still some justice in the world, and went to the royal palace and begged for an audience.  He was led before the king, who sat there with his daughter, and asked him what injury he had suffered.  Alas, said he, the frogs and the dogs have taken from me what is mine, and the butcher has paid me for it with the stick.  And he related at full length what had happened.  Thereupon the king daughter began to laugh heartily, and the king said to him, I cannot give you justice in this, but you shall have my daughter to wife for it - in her whole life she has never yet laughed as she has just done at you, and I have promised her to him who could make her laugh.  You may thank God for your good fortune. Oh, answered the peasant, I do not want her at all.  I have a wife already, and she is one too many for me, when I go home, it is just as if I had a wife standing in every corner.  Then the king grew angry, and said, you are a boor. Ah, lord king, replied the peasant, what can you expect from an ox, but beef.  Stop, answered the king, you shall have another reward. Be off now, but come back in three days, and then you shall have five hundred counted out in full. When the peasant went out by the gate, the sentry said, you have made the king daughter laugh, so you will certainly receive something good.  Yes, that is what I think, answered the peasant, five hundred are to be counted out to me. Listen, said the soldier, give me some of it.  What can you do with all that money.  As it is you, said the peasant, you shall have two hundred,  present yourself in three days, time before the king, and let it be paid to you.  A Jew, who was standing by and had heard the conversation, ran after the peasant, held him by the coat, and said, oh, wonder of God, what a child of fortune you are. I will change it for you, I will change it for you into small coins, what do you want with the great talers.  Jew, said the countryman, three hundred can you still have, give it to me at once in coin, in three days from this, you will be paid for it by the king.  The Jew was delighted with the small profit, and brought the sum in bad groschen, three of which were worth two good ones. After three days had passed, according to the king command, the peasant went before the king. Pull his coat off, said the latter, and he shall have his five hundred.  Ah, said the peasant, they no longer belong to me, I presented two hundred of them to the sentry, and three hundred the Jew has changed for me, so by right nothing at all belongs to me.  In the meantime the soldier and the Jew entered and claimed what they had gained from the peasant, and they received the blows strictly counted out.  The soldier bore it patiently and knew already how it tasted, but the Jew said sorrowfully, alas, alas, are these the heavy talers.  The king could not help laughing at the peasant, and when all his anger was spent, he said, as you have already lost your reward before it fell to your lot, I will give you compensation.  Go into my treasure chamber and get some money for yourself, as much as you will.  The peasant did not need to be told twice, and stuffed into his big pockets whatsoever would go in.  Afterwards he went to an inn and counted out his money. The Jew had crept after him and heard how he muttered to himself, that rogue of a king has cheated me after all, why could he not have given me the money himself, and then I should have known what I had.  How can I tell now if what I have had the luck to put in my pockets is right or not.  Good heavens, said the Jew to himself, that man is speaking disrespectfully of our lord the king, I will run and inform, and then I shall get a reward, and he will be punished as well. When the king heard of the peasant words he fell into a passion, and commanded the Jew to go and bring the offender to him.  The Jew ran to the peasant, you are to go at once to the lord king in the very clothes you have on.  I know what right better than that, answered the peasant, I shall have a new coat made first. Do you think that a man with so much money in his pocket should go there in his ragged old coat.  The Jew, as he saw that the peasant would not stir without another coat, and as he feared that if the king anger cooled, he himself would lose his reward, and the peasant his punishment, said, I will out of pure friendship lend you a coat for the short time.  What people will not do for love.  The peasant was contented with this, put the Jew coat on, and went off with him. The king reproached the countryman because of the evil speaking of which the Jew had informed him.  Ah, said the peasant, what a Jew says is always false - no true word ever comes out of his mouth.  That rascal there is capable of maintaining that I have his coat on. What is that, shrieked the Jew, is the coat not mine.  Have I not lent it to you out of pure friendship, in order that you might appear before the lord king.  When the king heard that, he said, the Jew has assuredly deceived one or the other of us, either myself or the peasant.  And again he ordered something to be counted out to him in hard thalers.  The peasant, however, went home in the good coat, with the good money in his pocket, and said to himself, this time I have made it. Hans had served his master for seven years, so he said to him, master, my time is up, now I should be glad to go back home to my mother, give me my wages.  The master answered, you have served me faithfully and honestly, as the service was so shall the reward be. And he gave Hans a piece of gold as big as his head.  Hans pulled his handkerchief out of his pocket, wrapped up the lump in it, put it on his shoulder, and set out on the way home.  As he went on, always putting one foot before the other, he saw a horseman trotting quickly and merrily by on a lively horse.  Ah, said Hans quite loud, what a fine thing it is to ride.  There you sit as on a chair, you stumble over no stones, you save your shoes, and cover the ground, you don;t know how.  The rider, who had heard him, stopped and called out, hi, there, Hans, why do you go on foot, then.  I must, answered he, for I have this lump to carry home, it is true that it is gold, but I cannot hold my head straight for it, and it hurts my shoulder.  I will tell you what, said the rider, we will exchange, I will give you my horse, and you can give me your lump. With all my heart, said Hans, but I can tell you, you will have to crawl along with it.  The rider got down, took the gold, and helped Hans up, then gave him the bridle tight in his hands and said, if you want to go at a really good pace, you must click your tongue and call out, jup.  Jup.  Hans was heartily delighted as he sat upon the horse and rode away so bold and free.  After a little while he thought that it ought to go faster, and he began to click with his tongue and call out, jup. Jup.  The horse put himself into a sharp trot, and before Hans knew where he was, he was thrown off and lying in a ditch which separated the field from the highway.  The horse would have gone off too if it had not been stopped by a countryman, who was coming along the road and driving a cow before him.  Hans pulled himself together and stood up on his legs again, but he was vexed, and said to the countryman, it is a poor joke, this riding, especially when one gets hold of a mare like this, that kicks and throws one off, so that one has a chance of breaking one neck. Never again will I mount it.  Now I like your cow, for one can walk quietly behind her, and have, over and above, one milk, butter and cheese every day without fail.  What would I not give to have such a cow.  Well, said the countryman, if it would give you so much pleasure, I do not mind giving the cow for the horse.  Hans agreed with the greatest delight, the countryman jumped upon the horse, and rode quickly away.  Hans drove his cow quietly before him, and thought over his lucky bargain.  If only I have a morsel of bread - and that can hardly fail me - I can eat butter and cheese with it as often as I like, if I am thirsty, I can milk my cow and drink the milk.  My goodness, what more can I want.  When he came to an inn he made a halt, and in his great concern ate up what he had with him - his dinner and supper - and all he had, and with his last few farthings had half a glass of beer. Then he drove his cow onwards along the road to his mother village.  As it drew nearer mid-day, the heat was more oppressive, and Hans found himself upon a moor which it took about an hour to cross.  He felt it very hot and his tongue clave to the roof of his mouth with thirst.  I can find a cure for this, thought Hans, I will milk the cow now and refresh myself with the milk. He tied her to a withered tree, and as he had no pail he put his leather cap underneath, but try as he would, not a drop of milk came.  And as he set himself to work in a clumsy way, the impatient beast at last gave him such a blow on his head with its hind foot, that he fell on the ground, and for a long time could not think where he was.  By good fortune a butcher just then came along the road with a wheel-barrow, in which lay a young pig.  What sort of a trick is this, cried he, and helped the good Hans up.  Hans told him what had happened.  The butcher gave him his flask and said, take a drink and refresh yourself.  The cow will certainly give no milk, it is an old beast, at the best it is only fit for the plough, or for the butcher. Well, well, said Hans, as he stroked his hair down on his head, who would have thought it.  Certainly it is a fine thing when one can kill a beast like that at home, what meat one has.  But I do not care much for beef, it is not juicy enough for me.  A young pig like that now is the thing to have, it tastes quite different, and then there are the sausages.  Listen, Hans, said the butcher, out of love for you I will exchange, and will let you have the pig for the cow.  Heaven repay you for your kindness, said Hans as he gave up the cow, whilst the pig was unbound from the barrow, and the cord by which it was tied was put in his hand.  Hans went on, and thought to himself how everything was going just as he wished, if he did meet with any vexation it was immediately set right.  Presently there joined him a lad who was carrying a fine white goose under his arm.  They said good morning to each other, and Hans began to tell of his good luck, and how he had always made such good bargains.  The boy told him that he was taking the goose to a christening-feast.  Just lift her, added he, and laid hold of her by the wings, how heavy she is - she has been fattened up for the last eight weeks.  Whosoever has a bit of her when she is roasted will have to wipe the fat from both sides of his mouth.  Yes, said Hans, as he weighed her in one hand, she is a good weight, but my pig is no bad one.  Meanwhile the lad looked suspiciously from one side to the other, and shook his head.  Look here, he said at length, it may not be all right with your pig.  In the village through which I passed, the mayor himself had just had one stolen out of its sty.  I fear - I fear that you have got hold of it there.  They have sent out some people and it would be a bad business if they caught you with the pig, at the very least, you would be shut up in the dark hole.  The good Hans was terrified.  Goodness, he said, help me out of this fix, you know more about this place than I do, take my pig and leave me your goose.  I shall risk something at that game, answered the lad, but I will not be the cause of your getting into trouble.  So he took the cord in his hand, and drove away the pig quickly along a by-path.  The good Hans, free from care, went homewards with the goose under his arm.  When I think over it properly, said he to himself, I have even gained by the exchange.  First there is the good roast meat, then the quantity of fat which will drip from it, and which will give me dripping for my bread for a quarter of a year, and lastly the beautiful white feathers.  I will have my pillow stuffed with them, and then indeed I shall go to sleep without rocking.  How glad my mother will be.  As he was going through the last village, there stood a scissors-grinder with his barrow, as his wheel whirred he sang,      I sharpen scissors and quickly grind,      my coat blows out in the wind behind.  Hans stood still and looked at him, at last he spoke to him and said, all well with you, as you are so merry with your grinding. Yes, answered the scissors-grinder, the trade has a golden foundation.  A real grinder is a man who as often as he puts his hand into his pocket finds gold in it.  But where did you buy that fine goose?  I did not buy it, but exchanged my pig for it.  And the pig?  That I got for a cow.  And the cow?  I took that instead of a horse.  And the horse?  For that I gave a lump of gold as big as my head.  And the gold?  Well, that was my wages for seven years, service.  You have known how to look after yourself each time, said the grinder.  If you can only get on so far as to hear the money jingle in your pocket whenever you stand up, you will have made your fortune.  How shall I manage that, said Hans.  You must be a grinder, as I am, nothing particular is wanted for it but a grindstone, the rest finds itself.  I have one here, it is certainly a little worn, but you need not give me anything for it but your goose, will you do it?  How can you ask, answered Hans.  I shall be the luckiest fellow on earth.  If I have money whenever I put my hand in my pocket, why should I ever worry again.  And he handed him the goose and received the grindstone in exchange.  Now, said the grinder, as he took up an ordinary heavy stone that lay by him, here is a strong stone for you into the bargain, you can hammer well upon it, and straighten your old nails.  Take it with you and keep it carefully. Hans loaded himself with the stones, and went on with a contented heart, his eyes shining with joy.  I must have been born with a caul, he cried, everything I want happens to me just as if I were a sunday-child.  Meanwhile, as he had been on his legs since daybreak, he began to feel tired.  Hunger also tormented him, for in his joy at the bargain by which he got the cow he had eaten up all his store of food at once.  At last he could only go on with great trouble, and was forced to stop every minute, the stones, too, weighed him down dreadfully. Then he could not help thinking how nice it would be if he had not to carry them just then.  He crept like a snail to a well in a field, and there he thought that he would rest and refresh himself with a cool draught of water, but in order that he might not injure the stones in sitting down, he laid them carefully by his side on the edge of the well. Then he sat down on it, and was to stoop and drink, when he made a slip, pushed against the stones, and both of them fell into the water.  When Hans saw them with his own eyes sinking to the bottom, he jumped for joy, and then knelt down, and with tears in his eyes thanked God for having shown him this favor also, and delivered him in so good a way, and without his having any need to reproach himself, from those heavy stones which had been the only things that troubled him.  There is no man under the sun so fortunate as I, he cried out. With a light heart and free from every burden he now ran on until he was with his mother at home. Hard by a great forest dwelt a poor wood-cutter with his wife and his two children.  The boy was called Hansel and the girl Gretel.  He had little to bite and to break, and once when great dearth fell on the land, he could no longer procure even daily bread.  Now when he thought over this by night in his bed, and tossed about in his anxiety, he groaned and said to his wife, what is to become of us.  How are we to feed our poor children, when we no longer have anything even for ourselves.  I;ll tell you what, husband, answered the woman, early to-morrow morning we will take the children out into the forest to where it is the thickest.  There we will light a fire for them, and give each of them one more piece of bread, and then we will go to our work and leave them alone.  They will not find the way home again, and we shall be rid of them.  No, wife, said the man, I will not do that. How can I bear to leave my children alone in the forest.   The wild animals would soon come and tear them to pieces.  O; you fool, said she, then we must all four die of hunger, you may as well plane the planks for our coffins, and she left him no peace until he consented.  But I feel very sorry for the poor children, all the same, said the man.  The two children had also not been able to sleep for hunger, and had heard what their step-mother had said to their father.  Gretel wept bitter tears, and said to Hansel, now all is over with us. Be quiet, Gretel, said Hansel, do not distress yourself, I will soon find a way to help us.  And when the old folks had fallen asleep, he got up, put on his little coat, opened the door below, and crept outside.  The moon shone brightly, and the white pebbles which lay in front of the house glittered like real silver pennies.  Hansel stooped and stuffed the little pocket of his coat with as many as he could get in.  Then he went back and said to Gretel, be comforted, dear little sister, and sleep in peace, God will not forsake us, and he lay down again in his bed.  When day dawned, but before the sun had risen, the woman came and awoke the two children, saying get up, you sluggards.  We are going into the forest to fetch wood.  She gave each a little piece of bread, and said, there is something for your dinner, but do not eat it up before then, for you will get nothing else.  Gretel took the bread under her apron, as Hansel had the pebbles in his pocket.  Then they all set out together on the way to the forest.  When they had walked a short time, Hansel stood still and peeped back at the house, and did so again and again.  His father said, Hansel, what are you looking at there and staying behind for.  Pay attention, and do not forget how to use your legs.  Ah, father, said Hansel, I am looking at my little white cat, which is sitting  up on the roof, and wants to say good-bye to me.  The wife said, fool, that is not your little cat, that is the morning sun which is shining on the chimneys.  Hansel, however, had not been looking back at the cat, but had been constantly throwing one of the white pebble-stones out of his pocket on the road.  When they had reached the middle of the forest, the father said, now, children, pile up some wood, and I will light a fire that you may not be cold.  Hansel and Gretel gathered brushwood together, as high as a little hill.  The brushwood was lighted, and when the flames were burning very high, the woman said, now, children, lay yourselves down by the fire and rest, we will go into the forest and cut some wood.  When we have done, we will come back and fetch you away.  Hansel and Gretel sat by the fire, and when noon came, each ate a little piece of bread, and as they heard the strokes of the wood-axe they believed that their father was near.  It was not the axe, however, but a branch which he had fastened to a withered tree which the wind was blowing backwards and forwards.  And as they had been sitting such a long time, their eyes closed with fatigue, and they fell fast asleep.  When at last they awoke, it was already dark night.  Gretel began to cry and said, how are we to get out of the forest now.  But Hansel comforted her and said, just wait a little, until the moon has risen, and then we will soon find the way.  And when the full moon had risen, Hansel took his little sister by the hand, and followed the pebbles which shone like newly-coined silver pieces, and showed them the way.  They walked the whole night long, and by break of day came once more to their father house.  They knocked at the door, and when the woman opened it and saw that it was Hansel and Gretel, she said, you naughty children, why have you slept so long in the forest.  We thought you were never coming back at all.  The father, however, rejoiced, for it had cut him to the heart to leave them behind alone.  Not long afterwards, there was once more great dearth throughout the land, and the children heard their mother saying at night to their father, everything is eaten again, we have one half loaf left, and that is the end.  The children must go, we will take them farther into the wood, so that they will not find their way out again.  There is no other means of saving ourselves.  The man heart was heavy, and he thought, it would be better for you to share the last mouthful with your children.  The woman, however, would listen to nothing that he had to say, but scolded and reproached him.  He who says a must say b, likewise, and as he had yielded the first time, he had to do so a second time also.  The children, however, were still awake and had heard the conversation.  When the old folks were asleep, Hansel again got up, and wanted to go out and pick up pebbles as he had done before, but the woman had locked the door, and Hansel could not get out. Nevertheless he comforted his little sister, and said, do not cry, Gretel, go to sleep quietly, the good God will help us. Early in the morning came the woman, and took the children out of their beds.  Their piece of bread was given to them, but it was still smaller than the time before.  On the way into the forest Hansel crumbled his in his pocket, and often stood still and threw a morsel on the ground.  Hansel, why do you stop and look round. Said the father, go on.  I am looking back at my little pigeon which is sitting on the roof, and wants to say good-bye to me, answered Hansel.  Fool.  Said the woman, that is not your little pigeon, that is the morning sun that is shining on the chimney. Hansel, however, little by little, threw all the crumbs on the path. The woman led the children still deeper into the forest, where they had never in their lives been before.  Then a great fire was again made, and the mother said, just sit there, you children, and when you are tired you may sleep a little.  We are going into the forest to cut wood, and in the evening when we are done, we will come and fetch you away.  When it was noon, Gretel shared her piece of bread with Hansel, who had scattered his by the way.  Then they fell asleep and evening passed, but no one came to the poor children.  They did not awake until it was dark night, and Hansel comforted his little sister and said, just wait, Gretel, until the moon rises, and then we shall see the crumbs of bread which I have strewn about, they will show us our way home again.  When the moon came they set out, but they found no crumbs, for the many thousands of birds which fly about in the woods and fields had picked them all up.  Hansel said to Gretel, we shall soon find the way, but they did not find it.  They walked the whole night and all the next day too from morning till evening, but they did not get out of the forest, and were very hungry, for they had nothing to eat but two or three berries, which grew on the ground.  And as they were so weary that their legs would carry them no longer, they lay down beneath a tree and fell asleep.  It was now three mornings since they had left their father house. They began to walk again, but they always came deeper into the forest, and if help did not come soon, they must die of hunger and weariness.  When it was mid-day, they saw a beautiful snow-white bird sitting on a bough, which sang so delightfully that they stood still and listened to it.  And when its song was over, it spread its wings and flew away before them, and they followed it until they reached a little house, on the roof of which it alighted.  And when they approached the little house they saw that it was built of bread and covered with cakes, but that the windows were of clear sugar.  We will set to work on that, said Hansel, and have a good meal.  I will eat a bit of the roof, and you Gretel, can eat some of the window, it will taste sweet.  Hansel reached up above, and broke off a little of the roof to try how it tasted, and Gretel leant against the window and nibbled at the panes.  Then a soft voice cried from the parlor -      nibble, nibble, gnaw      who is nibbling at my little house. The children answered -      the wind, the wind,      the heaven-born wind, and went on eating without disturbing themselves.  Hansel, who liked the taste of the roof, tore down a great piece of it, and Gretel pushed out the whole of one round window-pane, sat down, and enjoyed herself with it.  Suddenly the door opened, and a woman as old as the hills, who supported herself on crutches, came creeping out.  Hansel and Gretel were so terribly frightened that they let fall what they had in their hands. The old woman, however, nodded her head, and said, oh, you dear children, who has brought you here.  Do come in, and stay with me.  No harm shall happen to you.  She took them both by the hand, and led them into her little house.  Then good food was set before them, milk and pancakes, with sugar, apples, and nuts.  Afterwards two pretty little beds were covered with clean white linen, and Hansel and Gretel lay down in them, and thought they were in heaven.  The old woman had only pretended to be so kind.  She was in reality a wicked witch, who lay in wait for children, and had only built the little house of bread in order to entice them there.  When a child fell into her power, she killed it, cooked and ate it, and that was a feast day with her.  Witches have red eyes, and cannot see far, but they have a keen scent like the beasts, and are aware when human beings draw near.  When Hansel and Gretel came into her neighborhood, she laughed with malice, and said mockingly, I have them, they shall not escape me again.  Early in the morning before the children were awake, she was already up, and when she saw both of them sleeping and looking so pretty, with their plump and rosy cheeks, she muttered to herself, that will be a dainty mouthful.  Then she seized Hansel with her shrivelled hand, carried him into a little stable, and locked him in behind a grated door. Scream as he might, it would not help him.  Then she went to Gretel, shook her till she awoke, and cried, get up, lazy thing, fetch some water, and cook something good for your brother, he is in the stable outside, and is to be made fat.  When he is fat, I will eat him.  Gretel began to weep bitterly, but it was all in vain, for she was forced to do what the wicked witch commanded. And now the best food was cooked for poor Hansel, but Gretel got nothing but crab-shells.  Every morning the woman crept to the little stable, and cried, Hansel, stretch out your finger that I may feel if you will soon be fat.  Hansel, however, stretched out a little bone to her, and the old woman, who had dim eyes, could not see it, and thought it was Hansel finger, and was astonished that there was no way of fattening him.  When four weeks had gone by, and Hansel still remained thin, she was seized with impatience and would not wait any longer.  Now, then, Gretel, she cried to the girl, stir yourself, and bring some water.  Let Hansel be fat or lean, to-morrow I will kill him, and cook him.  Ah, how the poor little sister did lament when she had to fetch the water, and how her tears did flow down her cheeks.  Dear God, do help us, she cried.  If the wild beasts in the forest had but devoured us, we should at any rate have died together.  Just keep your noise to yourself, said the old woman, it won;t help you at all.  Early in the morning, Gretel had to go out and hang up the cauldron with the water, and light the fire.  We will bake first, said the old woman, I have already heated the oven, and kneaded the dough.  She pushed poor Gretel out to the oven, from which flames of fire were already darting.  Creep in, said the witch, and see if it properly heated, so that we can put the bread in. And once Gretel was inside, she intended to shut the oven and let her bake in it, and then she would eat her, too.  But Gretel saw what she had in mind, and said, I do not know how I am to do it. How do I get in.  Silly goose, said the old woman, the door is big enough.  Just look, I can get in myself, and she crept up and thrust her head into the oven.  Then Gretel gave her a push that drove her far into it, and shut the iron door, and fastened the bolt.  Oh.  Then she began to howl quite horribly, but Gretel ran away, and the godless witch was miserably burnt to death. Gretel, however, ran like lightning to Hansel, opened his little stable, and cried, Hansel, we are saved.  The old witch is dead. Then Hansel sprang like a bird from its cage when the door is opened.  How they did rejoice and embrace each other, and dance about and kiss each other.  And as they had no longer any need to fear her, they went into the witch house, and in every corner there stood chests full of pearls and jewels.  These are far better than pebbles. Said Hansel, and thrust into his pockets whatever could be got in, and Gretel said, I, too, will take something home with me, and filled her pinafore full.  But now we must be off, said Hansel, that we may get out of the witch forest.  When they had walked for two hours, they came to a great stretch of water.  We cannot cross, said Hansel, I see no foot-plank, and no bridge.  And there is also no ferry, answered Gretel, but a white duck is swimming there.  If I ask her, she will help us over.  Then she cried -      little duck, little duck, dost thou see,      Hansel and Gretel are waiting for thee.      There never a plank, or bridge in sight,      take us across on thy back so white. The duck came to them, and Hansel seated himself on its back, and told his sister to sit by him.  No, replied Gretel, that will be too heavy for the little duck.  She shall take us across, one after the other.  The good little duck did so, and when they were once safely across and had walked for a short time, the forest seemed to be more and more familiar to them, and at length they saw from afar their father house.  Then they began to run, rushed into the parlor, and threw themselves round their father neck.  The man had not known one happy hour since he had left the children in the forest.  The woman, however, was dead.  Gretel emptied her pinafore until pearls and precious stones ran about the room, and Hansel threw one handful after another out of his pocket to add to them.  Then all anxiety was at an end, and they lived together in perfect happiness.  My tale is done, there runs a mouse, whosoever catches it, may make himself a big fur cap out of it. There was once upon a time a king who had a great forest near his palace, full of all kinds of wild animals.  One day he sent out a huntsman to shoot him a roe, but he did not come back. Perhaps some accident has befallen him, said the king, and the next day he sent out two more huntsmen who were to search for him, but they too stayed away.  Then on the third day, he sent for all his huntsmen, and said, scour the whole forest through, and do not give up until you have found all three.  But of these also, none came home again, and of the pack of hounds which they had taken with them, none were seen again.  From that time forth, no one would any longer venture into the forest, and it lay there in deep stillness and solitude, and nothing was seen of it, but sometimes an eagle or a hawk flying over it.  This lasted for many years, when an unknown huntsman announced himself to the king as seeking a situation, and offered to go into the dangerous forest.  The king, however, would not give his consent, and said, it is not safe in there, I fear it would fare with you no better than with the others, and you would never come out again.  The huntsman replied, lord, I will venture it at my own risk, of fear I know nothing. The huntsman therefore betook himself with his dog to the forest. It was not long before the dog fell in with some game on the way, and wanted to pursue it, but hardly had the dog run two steps when it stood before a deep pool, could go no farther, and a naked arm stretched itself out of the water, seized it, and drew it under.  When the huntsman saw that, he went back and fetched three men to come with buckets and bale out the water.  When they could see to the bottom there lay a wild man whose body was brown like rusty iron, and whose hair hung over his face down to his knees.  They bound him with cords, and led him away to the castle.  There was great astonishment over the wild man, the king, however, had him put in an iron cage in his court-yard, and forbade the door to be opened on pain of death, and the queen herself was to take the key into her keeping. And from this time forth every one could again go into the forest with safety. The king had a son of eight years, who was once playing in the court-yard, and while he was playing, his golden ball fell into the cage.  The boy ran thither and said, give me my ball out. Not till you have opened the door for me, answered the man.  No, said the boy, I will not do that, the king has forbidden it, and ran away.  The next day he again went and asked for his ball.  The wild man said, open my door, but the boy would not.  On the third day the king had ridden out hunting, and the boy went once more and said, I cannot open the door even if I wished, for I have not the key. Then the wild man said, it lies under your mother pillow, you can get it there.  The boy, who wanted to have his ball back, cast all thought to the winds, and brought the key.  The door opened with difficulty, and the boy pinched his fingers.  When it was open the wild man stepped out, gave him the golden ball, and hurried away.  The boy had become afraid, he called and cried after him, oh, wild man, do not go away, or I shall be beaten.  The wild man turned back, took him up, set him on his shoulder, and went with hasty steps into the forest.  When the king came home, he observed the empty cage, and asked the queen how that had happened.  She knew nothing about it, and sought the key, but it was gone.  She called the boy, but no one answered. The king sent out people to seek for him in the fields, but they did not find him.  Then he could easily guess what had happened, and much grief reigned in the royal court. When the wild man had once more reached the dark forest, he took the boy down from his shoulder, and said to him, you will never see your father and mother again, but I will keep you with me, for you have set me free, and I have compassion on you.  If you do all I bid you, you shall fare well.  Of treasure and gold have I enough, and more than anyone in the world.  He made a bed of moss for the boy on which he slept, and the next morning the man took him to a well, and said, behold, the gold well is as bright and clear as crystal, you shall sit beside it, and take care that nothing falls into it, or it will be polluted.  I will come every evening to see if you have obeyed my order.  The boy placed himself by the brink of the well, and often saw a golden fish or a golden snake show itself therein, and took care that nothing fell in.  As he was thus sitting, his finger hurt him so violently that he involuntarily put it in the water.  He drew it quickly out again, but saw that it was quite gilded, and whatsoever pains he took to wash the gold off again, all was to no purpose.  In the evening iron Hans came back, looked at the boy, and said, what has happened to the well.  Nothing, nothing, he answered, and held his finger behind his back, that the man might not see it.  But he said, you have dipped your finger into the water, this time it may pass, but take care you do not again let anything go in.  By daybreak the boy was already sitting by the well and watching it.  His finger hurt him again and he passed it over his head, and then unhappily a hair fell down into the well.  He took it quickly out, but it was already quite gilded.  Iron Hans came, and already knew what had happened.  You have let a hair fall into the well, said he.  I will allow you to watch by it once more, but if this happens for the third time then the well is polluted, and you can no longer remain with me. On the third day, the boy sat by the well, and did not stir his finger, however much it hurt him.  But the time was long to him, and he looked at the reflection of his face on the surface of the water.  And as he still bent down more and more while he was doing so, and trying to look straight into the eyes, his long hair fell down from his shoulders into the water.  He raised himself up quickly, but the whole of the hair of his head was already golden and shone like the sun.  You can imagine how terrified the poor boy was.  He took his pocket-handkerchief and tied it round his head, in order that the man might not see it.  When he came he already knew everything, and said, take the handkerchief off.  Then the golden hair streamed forth, and let the boy excuse himself as he might, it was of no use. You have not stood the trial, and can stay here no longer.  Go forth into the world, there you will learn what poverty is.  But as you have not a bad heart, and as I mean well by you, there is one thing I will grant you.  If you fall into any difficulty, come to the forest and cry, iron Hans, and then I will come and help you.  My power is great, greater than you think, and I have gold and silver in abundance. Then the king son left the forest, and walked by beaten and unbeaten paths ever onwards until at length he reached a great city.  There he looked for work, but could find none, and he had learnt nothing by which he could help himself.  At length he went to the palace, and asked if they would take him in. The people about court did not at all know what use they could make of him, but they liked him, and told him to stay.  At length the cook took him into his service, and said he might carry wood and water, and rake the cinders together.  Once when it so happened that no one else was at hand, the cook ordered him to carry the food to the royal table, but as he did not like to let his golden hair be seen, he kept his little cap on.  Such a thing as that had never yet come under the king notice, and he said, when you come to the royal table you must take your hat off.  He answered, ah, lord, I cannot.  I have a bad sore place on my head.  Then the king had the cook called before him and scolded him, and asked how he could take such a boy as that into his service, and that he was to send him away at once.  The cook, however, had pity on him, and exchanged him for the gardener boy. And now the boy had to plant and water the garden, hoe and dig, and bear the wind and bad weather.  Once in summer when he was working alone in the garden, the day was so warm he took his little cap off that the air might cool him.  As the sun shone on his hair it glittered and flashed so that the rays fell into the bed-room of the king daughter, and up she sprang to see what that could be.  Then she saw the boy, and cried to him, boy, bring me a wreath of flowers.  He put his cap on with all haste, and gathered wild field-flowers and bound them together.  When he was ascending the stairs with them, the gardener met him, and said, how can you take the king daughter a garland of such common flowers.  Go quickly, and get another, and seek out the prettiest and rarest.  Oh, no, replied the boy, the wild ones have more scent, and will please her better. When he got into the room, the king daughter said, take your cap off, it is not seemly to keep it on in my presence. He again said, I may not, I have a sore head.  She, however, caught at his cap and pulled it off, and then his golden hair rolled down on his shoulders, and it was splendid to behold. He wanted to run out, but she held him by the arm, and gave him a handful of ducats.  With these he departed, but he cared nothing for the gold pieces.  He took them to the gardener, and said, I present them to your children, they can play with them.  The following day the king daughter again called to him that he was to bring her a wreath of field-flowers, and when he went in with it, she instantly snatched at his cap, and wanted to take it away from him, but he held it fast with both hands.  She again gave him a handful of ducats, but he would not keep them, and gave them to the gardener for playthings for his children.  On the third day things went just the same.  She could not get his cap away from him, and he would not have her money. Not long afterwards, the country was overrun by war.  The king gathered together his people, and did not know whether or not he could offer any opposition to the enemy, who was superior in strength and had a mighty army.  Then said the gardener boy, I am grown up, and will go to the wars also, only give me a I am grown up, and will go the the wars also, only give me a horse.  The others laughed, and said, seek one for yourself when we are gone, we will leave one behind us in the stable for you. When they had gone forth, he went into the stable, and led the horse out.  It was lame of one foot, and limped hobblety jig, hobblety jig, nevertheless he mounted it, and rode away to the dark forest.  When he came to the outskirts, he called ;iron Hans, three times so loudly that it echoed through the trees.  Thereupon the wild man appeared immediately, and said, what do you desire.  I want a strong steed, for I am going to the wars.  That you shall have, and still more than you ask for. Then the wild man went back into the forest, and it was not long before a stable-boy came out of it, who led a horse that snorted with its nostrils, and could hardly be restrained, and behind them followed a great troop of warriors entirely equipped in iron, and their swords flashed in the sun.  The youth made over his three-legged horse to the stable-boy, mounted the other, and rode at the head of the soldiers.  When he got near the battle-field a great part of the king men had already fallen, and little was wanting to make the rest give way. Then the youth galloped thither with his iron soldiers, broke like a hurricane over the enemy, and beat down all who opposed him.  They began to flee, but the youth pursued, and never stopped, until there was not a single man left.  Instead of returning to the king, however, he conducted his troop by byways back to the forest, and called forth iron Hans. What do you desire, asked the wild man.  Take back your horse and your troops, and give me my three-legged horse again.  All that he asked was done, and soon he was riding on his three-legged horse.  When the king returned to his palace, his daughter went to meet him, and wished him joy of his victory.  I am not the one who carried away the victory, said he, but a strange knight who came to my assistance with his soldiers.  The daughter wanted to hear who the strange knight was, but the king did not know, and said, he followed the enemy, and I did not see him again.  She inquired of the gardener where his boy was, but he smiled, and said, he has just come home on his three-legged horse, and the others have been mocking him, and crying, here comes our hobblety jig back again.  They asked, too, under what hedge have you been lying sleeping all the time.  So he said, I did the best of all, and it would have gone badly without me.  And then he was still more ridiculed. The king said to his daughter, I will proclaim a great feast that shall last for three days, and you shall throw a golden apple.  Perhaps the unknown man will show himself.  When the feast was announced, the youth went out to the forest, and called iron Hans.  What do you desire, asked he.  That I may catch the king daughter golden apple.  It is as safe as if you had it already, said iron Hans.  You shall likewise have a suit of red armor for the occasion, and ride on a spirited chestnut-horse. When the day came, the youth galloped to the spot, took his place amongst the knights, and was recognized by no one.  The king daughter came forward, and threw a golden apple to the knights, but none of them caught it but he, only as soon as he had it he galloped away. On the second day iron Hans equipped him as a white knight, and gave him a white horse.  Again he was the only one who caught the apple, and he did not linger an instant, but galloped off with it.  The king grew angry, and said, that is not allowed. He must appear before me and tell his name.  He gave the order that if the knight who caught the apple, should go away again they should pursue him, and if he would not come back willingly, they were to cut him down and stab him. On the third day, he received from iron Hans a suit of black armor and a black horse, and again he caught the apple.  But when he was riding off with it, the king attendants pursued him, and one of them got so near him that he wounded the youth leg with the point of his sword.  The youth nevertheless escaped from them, but his horse leapt so violently that the helmet fell from the youth head, and they could see that he had golden hair.  They rode back and announced this to the king. The following day the king daughter asked the gardener about his boy.  He is at work in the garden.  The queer creature has been at the festival too, and only came home yesterday evening. He has likewise shown my children three golden apples which he has won. The king had him summoned into his presence, and he came and again had his little cap on his head.  But the king daughter went up to him and took it off, and then his golden hair fell down over his shoulders, and he was so handsome that all were amazed. Are you the knight who came every day to the festival, always in different colors, and who caught the three golden apples, asked the king.  Yes, answered he, and here the apples are, and he took them out of his pocket, and returned them to the king.  If you desire further proof, you may see the wound which your people gave me when they followed me.  But I am likewise the knight who helped you to your victory over your enemies.  If you can perform such deeds as that, you are no gardener boy, tell me, who is your father.  My father is a mighty king, and gold have I in plenty as great as I require.  I well see, said the king, that I owe thanks to you, can I do anything to please you.  Yes, answered he, that indeed you can.  Give me your daughter to wife. The maiden laughed, and said, he does not stand much on ceremony, but I have already seen by his golden hair that he was no gardener boy, and then she went and kissed him.  His father and mother came to the wedding, and were in great delight, for they had given up all hope of ever seeing their dear son again.  And as they were sitting at the marriage-feast, the music suddenly stopped, the doors opened, and a stately king came in with a great retinue.  He went up to the youth, embraced him and said, I am iron Hans, and was by enchantment a wild man, but you have set me free.  All the treasures which I possess, shall be your property. There were once three brothers who had fallen deeper and deeper into poverty, and at last their need was so great that they had to endure hunger, and had nothing to eat or drink. Then said they, it cannot go on like this, we had better go into the world and seek our fortune. They therefore set out, and had already walked over many a long road and many a blade of grass, but had not yet met with good luck.  One day they arrived in a great forest, and in the midst of it was a hill, and when they came nearer they saw that the hill was all silver.  Then spoke the eldest, now I have found the good luck I wished for, and I desire nothing more.  He took as much of the silver as he could possibly carry, and then turned back and went home again.  But the two others said, we want something more from good luck than mere silver, and did not touch it, but went onwards.  After they had walked for two days longer without stopping, they came to a hill which was all gold. The second brother stopped, took thought with himself, and was undecided.  What shall I do, said he, shall I take for myself so much of this gold, that I have sufficient for all the rest of my life, or shall I go farther.  At length he made a decision, and putting as much into his pockets as would go in, said farewell to his brother, and went home.  But the third said, silver and gold do not move me, I will not renounce my chance of fortune, perhaps something better still will be given me.  He journeyed onwards, and when he had walked for three days, he came to a forest which was still larger than the one before, and never would come to an end, and as he found nothing to eat or to drink, he was all but exhausted.  Then he climbed up a high tree to find out if up there he could see the end of the forest, but so far as his eye could pierce he saw nothing but the tops of trees.  Then he began to descend the tree again, but hunger tormented him, and he thought to himself, if I could but eat my fill once more.  When he got down he saw with astonishment a table beneath the tree richly spread with food, the steam of which rose up to meet him. This time, said he, my wish has been fulfilled at the right moment. And without inquiring who had brought the food, or who had cooked it, he approached the table, and ate with enjoyment until he had appeased his hunger.  When he was done, he thought, it would after all be a pity if the pretty little table-cloth were to be spoilt in the forest here, and folded it up tidily and put it in his pocket.  Then he went onwards, and in the evening, when hunger once more returned to him, he wanted to make a trial of his little cloth, and spread it out and said, I wish you to be covered with good cheer again, and scarcely had the wish crossed his lips than as many dishes with the most exquisite food on them stood on the table as there was room for.  Now I perceive, said he, in what kitchen my cooking is done.  You shall be dearer to me than the mountains of silver and gold.  For he saw plainly that it was a wishing-cloth. The cloth, however, was still not enough to enable him to sit down quietly at home, he preferred to wander about the world and pursue his fortune farther.  One night he met, in a lonely wood, a dusty, black charcoal-burner, who was burning charcoal there, and had some potatoes by the fire, on which he was going to make a meal.  Good evening, blackbird, said the youth.  How do you get on in your solitude.  One day is like another, replied the charcoal-burner, and every night potatoes.  Have you a mind to have some, and will you be my guest. Many thanks, replied the traveler, I won;t rob you of your supper, you did not reckon on a visitor, but if you will put up with what I have, you shall have an invitation. Who is to prepare it for you, said the charcoal-burner.  I see that you have nothing with you, and there is no one within a two hours; walk who could give you anything. And yet there shall be a meal, answered the youth, and better than any you have ever tasted.  Thereupon he brought his cloth out of his knapsack, spread it on the ground, and said, little cloth, cover yourself, and instantly boiled meat and baked meat stood there, and as hot as if it had just come out of the kitchen.  The charcoal-burner stared with wide-open eyes, but did not require much pressing, he fell to, and thrust larger and larger mouthfuls into his black mouth.  When they had eaten everything, the charcoal-burner smiled contentedly, and said, listen, your table-cloth has my approval, it would be a fine thing for me in this forest, where no one ever cooks me anything good.  I will propose an exchange to you, there in the corner hangs a soldier knapsack, which is certainly old and shabby, but in it lie concealed wonderful powers, but, as I no longer use it, I will give it to you for the table-cloth.  I must first know what these wonderful powers are, answered the youth.  That will I tell you, replied the charcoal-burner, every time you tap it with your hand, a corporal comes with six men armed from head to foot, and they do whatsover you command them.  So far as I am concerned, said the youth, if nothing else can be done, we will exchange, and he gave the charcoal-burner the cloth, took the knapsack from the hook, put it on, and bade farewell.  When he had walked a while, he wished to make a trial of the magical powers of his knapsack and tapped it.  Immediately the seven warriors stepped up to him, and the corporal said, what does my lord and ruler wish for.  March with all speed to the charcoal-burner, and demand my wishing-cloth back.  They faced to the left, and it was not long before they brought what he required, and had taken it from the charcoal-burner without asking many questions.  The young man bade them retire, went onwards, and hoped fortune would shine yet more brightly on him.  By sunset he came to another charcoal-burner, who was making his supper ready by the fire. If you will eat some potatoes with salt, but with no dripping, come and sit down with me, said the sooty fellow.  No, he replied, this time you shall be my guest, and he spread out his cloth, which was instantly covered with the most beautiful dishes.  They ate and drank together, and enjoyed themselves heartily.  After the meal was over, the charcoal-burner said, up there on that shelf lies a little old worn-out hat which has strange properties - the moment someone puts it on, and turns it round on his head, the cannons go off as if twelve were fired all together, and they demolish everything so that no one can withstand them.  The hat is of no use to me, and I will willingly give it for your tablecloth.  That suits me very well, he answered, took the hat, put it on, and left his table-cloth behind him.  But hardly had he walked away than he tapped on his knapsack, and his soldiers had to fetch the cloth back again.  One thing comes on the top of another, thought he, and I feel as if my luck had not yet come to an end.  Neither had his thoughts deceived him.  After he had walked on for the whole of one day, he came to a third charcoal-burner, who like the previous one, invited him to potatoes without dripping.  But he let him also dine with him from his wishing-cloth, and the charcoal-burner liked it so well, that at last he offered him a horn for it, which had very different properties from those of the hat.  The moment someone blew it all the walls and fortifications fell down, and all towns and villages became ruins.  For this he immediately gave the charcoal-burner the cloth, but he afterwards sent his soldiers to demand it back again, so that at length he had the knapsack, hat and horn, all three.  Now, said he, I am a made man, and it is time for me to go home and see how my brothers are getting on.  When he reached home, his brothers had built themselves a handsome house with their silver and gold, and were living in clover. He went to see them, but as he came in a ragged coat, with his shabby hat on his head, and his old knapsack on his back, they would not acknowledge him as their brother.  They mocked and said, you give out that you are our brother who despised silver and gold, and craved for something still better for himself.  Such a person arrives in his carriage in full splendor like a mighty king, not like a beggar, and they drove him out of doors.  Then he fell into a rage, and tapped his knapsack until a hundred and fifty men stood before him armed from head to foot.  He commanded them to surround his brothers, house, and two of them were to take hazelsticks with them, and beat the two insolent men until they knew who he was.  A violent disturbance broke out, people ran together, and wanted to lend the two some help in their need, but against the soldiers they could do nothing.  News of this at length came to the king, who was very angry, and ordered a captain to march out with his troop, and drive this disturber of the peace out of the town, but the man with knapsack soon got a greater body of men together, who repulsed the captain and his men, so that they were forced to retire with bloody noses.  The king said, this vagabond is not brought to order yet, and next day sent a still larger troop against him, but they could do even less.  The youth set still more men against them, and in order to be done the sooner, he turned his hat twice round on his head, and heavy guns began to play, and the king men were beaten and put to flight.  And now, said he, I will not make peace until the king gives me his daughter to wife, and I govern the whole kingdom in his name.  He caused this to be announced to the king, and the latter said to his daughter, necessity is a hard nut to crack.  What else is there for me to do but what he desires.  If I want peace and to keep the crown on my head, I must give you away.  So the wedding was celebrated, but the king daughter was vexed that her husband should be a common man, who wore a shabby hat, and put on an old knapsack.  She longed to get rid of him, and night and day studied how she could accomplished this.  Then she thought to herself, is it possible that his wonderful powers lie in the knapsack, and she feigned affection and caressed him, and when his heart was softened, she said, if you would but lay aside that horrid knapsack, it makes you look so ugly, that I can;t help being ashamed of you.  Dear child, said he, this knapsack is my greatest treasure, as long as I have it, there is no power on earth that I am afraid of. And he revealed to her the wonderful virtue with which it was endowed.  Then she threw herself in his arms as if she were going to kiss him, but cleverly took the knapsack off his shoulders, and ran away with it.  As soon as she was alone she tapped it, and commanded the warriors to seize their former master, and take him out of the royal palace.  They obeyed, and the false wife sent still more men after him, who were to drive him quite out of the country.  Then he would have been ruined if he had not had the little hat.  And hardly were his hands free before he turned it twice.  Immediately the cannon began to thunder, and demolished everything, and the king daughter herself was forced to come and beg for mercy.  As she entreated in such moving terms, and promised to better her ways, he allowed himself to be persuaded and granted her peace.  She behaved in a friendly manner to him, and acted as if she loved him very much, and after some time managed so to befool him, that he confided to her that even if someone got the knapsack into his power, he could do nothing against him so long as the old hat was still his. When she knew the secret, she waited until he was asleep, and then she took the hat away from him, and had it thrown out into the street.  But the horn still remained to him, and in great anger he blew it with all his strength.  Instantly all walls, fortifications, towns, and villages, toppled down, and crushed the king and his daughter to death. And had he not put down the horn and had blown just a little longer, everything would have been in ruins, and not one stone would have been left standing on another.  Then no one opposed him any longer, and he made himself king of the whole country. Little  Once upon a time there was a dear little girl who was loved by every one who looked at her, but most of all by her grandmother, and there was nothing that she would not have given to the child.  Once she gave her a little cap of red velvet, which suited her so well that she would never wear anything else.  So she was always called little red-cap.  One day her mother said to her, come, little red-cap, here is a piece of cake and a bottle of wine.  Take them to your grandmother, she is ill and weak, and they will do her good. Set out before it gets hot, and when you are going, walk nicely and quietly and do not run off the path, or you may fall and break the bottle, and then your grandmother will get nothing.  And when you go into her room, don;t forget to say, good-morning, and don;t peep into every corner before you do it.  I will take great care, said little red-cap to her mother, and gave her hand on it.  The grandmother lived out in the wood, half a league from the village, and just as little red-cap entered the wood, a wolf met her.  Red-cap did not know what a wicked creature he was, and was not at all afraid of him.  "Good-day, little red-cap," said he.  "Thank you kindly, wolf."  "Whither away so early, little red-cap?"  "To my grandmother."  "What have you got in your apron?"  "Cake and wine.  Yesterday was baking-day, so poor sick grandmother is to have something good, to make her stronger."  "Where does your grandmother live, little red-cap?"  "A good quarter of a league farther on in the wood.  Her house stands under the three large oak-trees, the nut-trees are just below.  You surely must know it," replied little red-cap.  The wolf thought to himself, what a tender young creature.  What a nice plump mouthful, she will be better to eat than the old woman.  I must act craftily, so as to catch both.  So he walked for a short time by the side of little red-cap, and then he said, "see little red-cap, how pretty the flowers are about here. Why do you not look round.  I believe, too, that you do not hear how sweetly the little birds are singing.  You walk gravely along as if you were going to school, while everything else out here in the wood is merry."  Little red-cap raised her eyes, and when she saw the sunbeams dancing here and there through the trees, and pretty flowers growing everywhere, she thought, suppose I take grandmother a fresh nosegay.  That would please her too.  It is so early in the day that I shall still get there in good time.  And so she ran from the path into the wood to look for flowers.  And whenever she had picked one, she fancied that she saw a still prettier one farther on, and ran after it, and so got deeper and deeper into the wood.  Meanwhile the wolf ran straight to the grandmother house and knocked at the door.  "Who is there?"  "Little red-cap," replied the wolf.  "She is bringing cake and wine.  Open the door."  "Lift the latch," called out the grandmother, "I am too weak, and cannot get up."  The wolf lifted the latch, the door sprang open, and without saying a word he went straight to the grandmother bed, and devoured her.  Then he put on her clothes, dressed himself in her cap, laid himself in bed and drew the curtains.  Little red-cap, however, had been running about picking flowers, and when she had gathered so many that she could carry no more, she remembered her grandmother, and set out on the way to her.  She was surprised to find the cottage-door standing open, and when she went into the room, she had such a strange feeling that she said to herself, oh dear, how uneasy I feel to-day, and at other times I like being with grandmother so much.  She called out, "good morning," but received no answer.  So she went to the bed and drew back the curtains.  There lay her grandmother with her cap pulled far over her face, and looking very strange.  "Oh, grandmother," she said, "what big ears you have."  "The better to hear you with, my child," was the reply.  "But, grandmother, what big eyes you have," she said.  "The better to see you with," my dear.  "But, grandmother, what large hands you have."  "The better to hug you with."  "Oh, but, grandmother, what a terrible big mouth you have."  "The better to eat you with."  And scarcely had the wolf said this, than with one bound he was out of bed and swallowed up red-cap.  When the wolf had appeased his appetite, he lay down again in the bed, fell asleep and began to snore very loud.  The huntsman was just passing the house, and thought to himself, how the old woman is snoring.  I must just see if she wants anything.  So he went into the room, and when he came to the bed, he saw that the wolf was lying in it.  Do I find you here, you old sinner, said he.  I have long sought you.  Then just as he was going to fire at him, it occurred to him that the wolf might have devoured the grandmother, and that she might still be saved, so he did not fire, but took a pair of scissors, and began to cut open the stomach of the sleeping wolf.  When he had made two snips, he saw the little red-cap shining, and then he made two snips more, and the little girl sprang out, crying, ah, how frightened I have been.  How dark it was inside the wolf.  And after that the aged grandmother came out alive also, but scarcely able to breathe.  Red-cap, however, quickly fetched great stones with which they filled the wolf belly, and when he awoke, he wanted to run away, but the stones were so heavy that he collapsed at once, and fell dead.  Then all three were delighted.  The huntsman drew off the wolf skin and went home with it.  The grandmother ate the cake and drank the wine which red-cap had brought, and revived, but red-cap thought to herself, as long as I live, I will never by myself leave the path, to run into the wood, when my mother has forbidden me to do so.  It is also related that once when red-cap was again taking cakes to the old grandmother, another wolf spoke to her, and tried to entice her from the path.  Red-cap, however, was on her guard, and went straight forward on her way, and told her grandmother that she had met the wolf, and that he had said good-morning to her, but with such a wicked look in his eyes, that if they had not been on the public road she was certain he would have eaten her up.  Well, said the grandmother, we will shut the door, that he may not come in.  Soon afterwards the wolf knocked, and cried, open the door, grandmother, I am little red-cap, and am bringing you some cakes.  But they did not speak, or open the door, so the grey-beard stole twice or thrice round the house, and at last jumped on the roof, intending to wait until red-cap went home in the evening, and then to steal after her and devour her in the darkness.  But the grandmother saw what was in his thoughts.  In front of the house was a great stone trough, so she said to the child, take the pail, red-cap.  I made some sausages yesterday, so carry the water in which I boiled them to the trough.  Red-cap carried until the great trough was quite full.   Then the smell of the sausages reached the wolf, and he sniffed and peeped down, and at last stretched out his neck so far that he could no longer keep his footing and began to slip, and slipped down from the roof straight into the great trough, and was drowned. But red-cap went joyously home, and no one ever did anything to harm her again. There was once a widow who had two daughters - one of whom was pretty and industrious, whilst the other was ugly and idle.  But she was much fonder of the ugly and idle one, because she was her own daughter.  And the other, who was a step-daughter, was obliged to do all the work, and be the cinderella of the house.  Every day the poor girl had to sit by a well, in the highway, and spin and spin till her fingers bled. Now it happened that one day the shuttle was marked with her blood, so she dipped it in the well, to wash the mark off, but it dropped out of her hand and fell to the bottom.  She began to weep, and ran to her step-mother and told her of the mishap.  But she scolded her sharply, and was so merciless as to say, since you have let the shuttle fall in, you must fetch it out again. So the girl went back to the well, and did not know what to do. And in the sorrow of her heart she jumped into the well to get the shuttle.  She lost her senses.  And when she awoke and came to herself again, she was in a lovely meadow where the sun was shining and many thousands of flowers were growing.  Across this meadow she went, and at last came to a baker oven full of bread, and the bread cried out, oh, take me out. Take me out. Or I shall burn.  I have been baked a long time.  So she went up to it, and took out all the loaves one after another with the bread-shovel. After that she went on till she came to a tree covered with apples, which called out to her,  oh, shake me. Shake me. We apples are all ripe.  So she shook the tree till the apples fell like rain, and went on shaking till they were all down, and when she had gathered them into a heap, she went on her way. At last she came to a little house, out of which an old woman peeped.  But she had such large teeth that the girl was frightened, and was about to run away.  But the old woman called out to her, what are you afraid of, dear child.  Stay with me. If you will do all the work in the house properly, you shall be the better for it.  Only you must take care to make my bed well, and shake it thoroughly till the feathers fly - for then there is snow on the earth.  I am mother holle. As the old woman spoke so kindly to her, the girl took courage and agreed to enter her service.  She attended to everything to the satisfaction of her mistress, and always shook her bed so vigorously that the feathers flew about like snow-flakes.  So she had a pleasant life with her.  Never an angry word.  And to eat she had boiled or roast meat every day. She stayed some time with mother holle, before she became sad. At first she did not know what was the matter with her, but found at length that it was home-sickness.  Although she was many thousand times better off here than at home, still she had a longing to be there.  At last she said to the old woman, I have a longing for home, and however well off I am down here, I cannot stay any longer.  I must go up again to my own people.  Mother holle said, I am pleased that you long for your home again, and as you have served me so truly, I myself will take you up again.  Thereupon she took her by the hand, and led her to a large door.  The door was opened, and just as the maiden was standing beneath the doorway, a heavy shower of golden rain fell, and all the gold clung to her, so that she was completely covered over with it. You shall have that because you have been so industrious, said mother holle, and at the same time she gave her back the shuttle which she had let fall into the well.  Thereupon the door closed, and the maiden found herself up above upon the earth, not far from her mother house. And as she went into the yard the chicken was sitting on the well, and cried -      chicken-a-doodle-doo.      Your golden girl come back to you. So she went in to her mother, and as she arrived thus covered with gold, she was well received, both by her and her sister. The girl told all that had happened to her, and as soon as the mother heard how she had come by so much wealth, she was very anxious to obtain the same good luck for the ugly and lazy daughter. She had to seat herself by the well and spin.  And in order that her shuttle might be stained with blood, she stuck her hand into a thorn bush and pricked her finger.  Then she threw her shuttle into the well, and jumped in after it. She came, like the other, to the beautiful meadow and walked along the very same path.  When she got to the oven the bread again cried, oh, take me out. Take me out. Or I shall burn.  I have been baked a long time.  But the lazy thing answered, as if I had any wish to make myself dirty. And on she went.  Soon she came to the apple-tree, which cried, oh, shake me. Shake me. We apples are all ripe.  But she answered, I like that.  One of you might fall on my head, and so went on.  When she came to mother holle house she was not afraid, for she had already heard of her big teeth, and she hired herself to her immediately. The first day she forced herself to work diligently, and obeyed mother holle when she told her to do anything, for she was thinking of all the gold that she would give her.  But on the second day she began to be lazy, and on the third day still more so, and then she would not get up in the morning at all.  Neither did she make mother holle bed as she ought, and did not shake it so as to make the feathers fly up.  Mother holle was soon tired of this, and gave her notice to leave.  The lazy girl was willing enough to go, and thought that now the golden rain would come.  Mother holle led her also to the great door, but while she was standing beneath it, instead of the gold a big kettleful of pitch was emptied over her. That is the reward for your service, said mother holle, and shut the door. So the lazy girl went home, but she was quite covered with pitch, and the chicken on the well, as soon as he saw her, cried out -      chicken-a-doodle-doo.      Your dirty girl come back to you. But the pitch clung fast to her, and could not be got off as long as she lived. There were once a man and a woman who had long in vain wished for a child.  At length the woman hoped that God was about to grant her desire.  These people had a little window at the back of their house from which a splendid garden could be seen, which was full of the most beautiful flowers and herbs.  It was, however, surrounded by a high wall, and no one dared to go into it because it belonged to an enchantress, who had great power and was dreaded by all the world.  One day the woman was standing by this window and looking down into the garden, when she saw a bed which was planted with the most beautiful rampion - rapunzel, and it looked so fresh and green that she longed for it, and had the greatest desire to eat some.  This desire increased every day, and as she knew that she could not get any of it, she quite pined away, and began to look pale and miserable. Then her husband was alarmed, and asked, what ails you, dear wife.  Ah, she replied, if I can;t eat some of the rampion, which is in the garden behind our house, I shall die.  The man, who loved her, thought, sooner than let your wife die, bring her some of the rampion yourself, let it cost what it will.  At twilight, he clambered down over the wall into the garden of the enchantress, hastily clutched a handful of rampion, and took it to his wife.  She at once made herself a salad of it, and ate it greedily.  It tasted so good to her - so very good, that the next day she longed for it three times as much as before.  If he was to have any rest, her husband must once more descend into the garden.  In the gloom of evening, therefore, he let himself down again.  But when he had clambered down the wall he was terribly afraid, for he saw the enchantress standing before him.  How can you dare, said she with angry look, descend into my garden and steal my rampion like a thief.  You shall suffer for it.  Ah, answered he, let mercy take the place of justice, I only made up my mind to do it out of necessity.  My wife saw your rampion from the window, and felt such a longing for it that she would have died if she had not got some to eat.  Then the enchantress allowed her anger to be softened, and said to him, if the case be as you say, I will allow you to take away with you as much rampion as you will, only I make one condition, you must give me the child which your wife will bring into the world.  It shall be well treated, and I will care for it like a mother.  The man in his terror consented to everything, and when the woman was brought to bed, the enchantress appeared at once, gave the child the name of rapunzel, and took it away with her. Rapunzel grew into the most beautiful child under the sun. When she was twelve years old, the enchantress shut her into a tower, which lay in a forest, and had neither stairs nor door, but quite at the top was a little window.  When the enchantress wanted to go in, she placed herself beneath it and cried,      rapunzel, rapunzel,      let down your hair to me. Rapunzel had magnificent long hair, fine as spun gold, and when she heard the voice of the enchantress she unfastened her braided tresses, wound them round one of the hooks of the window above, and then the hair fell twenty ells down, and the enchantress climbed up by it. After a year or two, it came to pass that the king son rode through the forest and passed by the tower.  Then he heard a song, which was so charming that he stood still and listened.  This was rapunzel, who in her solitude passed her time in letting her sweet voice resound.  The king son wanted to climb up to her, and looked for the door of the tower, but none was to be found.  He rode home, but the singing had so deeply touched his heart, that every day he went out into the forest and listened to it.  Once when he was thus standing behind a tree, he saw that an enchantress came there, and he heard how she cried,      rapunzel, rapunzel,      let down your hair. Then rapunzel let down the braids of her hair, and the enchantress climbed up to her.  If that is the ladder by which one mounts, I too will try my fortune, said he, and the next day when it began to grow dark, he went to the tower and cried,      rapunzel, rapunzel,      let down your hair. Immediately the hair fell down and the king son climbed up. At first rapunzel was terribly frightened when a man, such as her eyes had never yet beheld, came to her.  But the king son began to talk to her quite like a friend, and told her that his heart had been so stirred that it had let him have no rest, and he had been forced to see her.  Then rapunzel lost her fear, and when he asked her if she would take him for her husband, and she saw that he was young and handsome, she thought, he will love me more than old dame gothel does.  And she said yes, and laid her hand in his. She said, I will willingly go away with you, but I do not know how to get down.  Bring with you a skein of silk every time that you come, and I will weave a ladder with it, and when that is ready I will descend, and you will take me on your horse.  They agreed that until that time he should come to her every evening, for the old woman came by day.  The enchantress remarked nothing of this, until once rapunzel said to her, tell me, dame gothel, how it happens that you are so much heavier for me to draw up than the young king son - he is with me in a moment.  Ah. You wicked child, cried the enchantress.  What do I hear you say.  I thought I had separated you from all the world, and yet you have deceived me.  In her anger she clutched rapunzel beautiful tresses, wrapped them twice round her left hand, seized a pair of scissors with the right, and snip, snap, they were cut off, and the lovely braids lay on the ground.  And she was so pitiless that she took poor rapunzel into a desert where she had to live in great grief and misery. On the same day that she cast out rapunzel, however, the enchantress fastened the braids of hair, which she had cut off, to the hook of the window, and when the king son came and cried,      rapunzel, rapunzel,      let down your hair, she let the hair down.  The king son ascended, but instead of finding his dearest rapunzel, he found the enchantress, who gazed at him with wicked and venomous looks.  Aha, she cried mockingly, you would fetch your dearest, but the beautiful bird sits no longer singing in the nest.  The cat has got it, and will scratch out your eyes as well.  Rapunzel is lost to you.  You will never see her again.  The king son was beside himself with pain, and in his despair he leapt down from the tower.  He escaped with his life, but the thorns into which he fell pierced his eyes.  Then he wandered quite blind about the forest, ate nothing but roots and berries, and did naught but lament and weep over the loss of his dearest wife.  Thus he roamed about in misery for some years, and at length came to the desert where rapunzel, with the twins to which she had given birth, a boy and a girl, lived in wretchedness.  He heard a voice, and it seemed so familiar to him that he went towards it, and when he approached, rapunzel knew him and fell on his neck and wept.  Two of her tears wetted his eyes and they grew clear again, and he could see with them as before.  He led her to his kingdom where he was joyfully received, and they lived for a long time afterwards, happy and contented. Rumpelstiltskin  Once there was a miller who was poor, but who had a beautiful daughter.  Now it happened that he had to go and speak to the king, and in order to make himself appear important he said to him, I have a daughter who can spin straw into gold.  The king said to the miller, that is an art which pleases me well, if your daughter is as clever as you say, bring her to-morrow to my palace, and I will put her to the test.  And when the girl was brought to him he took her into a room which was quite full of straw, gave her a spinning-wheel and a reel, and said, now set to work, and if by to-morrow morning early you have not spun this straw into gold during the night, you must die.  Thereupon he himself locked up the room, and left her in it alone.  So there sat the poor miller daughter, and for the life of her could not tell what to do, she had no idea how straw could be spun into gold, and she grew more and more frightened, until at last she began to weep.  But all at once the door opened, and in came a little man, and said, good evening, mistress miller, why are you crying so. Alas, answered the girl, I have to spin straw into gold, and I do not know how to do it.  What will you give me, said the manikin, if I do it for you.  My necklace, said the girl.  The little man took the necklace, seated himself in front of the wheel, and whirr, whirr, whirr, three turns, and the reel was full, then he put another on, and whirr, whirr, whirr, three times round, and the second was full too.  And so it went on until the morning, when all the straw was spun, and all the reels were full of gold.  By daybreak the king was already there, and when he saw the gold he was astonished and delighted, but his heart became only more greedy.  He had the miller daughter taken into another room full of straw, which was much larger, and commanded her to spin that also in one night if she valued her life.  The girl knew not how to help herself, and was crying, when the door opened again, and the little man appeared, and said, what will you give me if I spin that straw into gold for you.  The ring on my finger, answered the girl.  The little man took the ring, again began to turn the wheel, and by morning had spun all the straw into glittering gold.  The king rejoiced beyond measure at the sight, but still he had not gold enough, and he had the miller daughter taken into a still larger room full of straw, and said, you must spin this, too, in the course of this night, but if you succeed, you shall be my wife.  Even if she be a miller daughter, thought he, I could not find a richer wife in the whole world.  When the girl was alone the manikin came again for the third time, and said, what will you give me if I spin the straw for you this time also.  I have nothing left that I could give, answered the girl.  Then promise me, if you should become queen, to give me your first child.  Who knows whether that will ever happen, thought the miller daughter, and, not knowing how else to help herself in this strait, she promised the manikin what he wanted, and for that he once more spun the straw into gold.  And when the king came in the morning, and found all as he had wished, he took her in marriage, and the pretty miller daughter became a queen.  A year after, she brought a beautiful child into the world, and she never gave a thought to the manikin.  But suddenly he came into her room, and said, now give me what you promised.  The queen was horror-struck, and offered the manikin all the riches of the kingdom if he would leave her the child.  But the manikin said, no, something alive is dearer to me than all the treasures in the world.  Then the queen began to lament and cry, so that the manikin pitied her.  I will give you three days, time, said he, if by that time you find out my name, then shall you keep your child.  So the queen thought the whole night of all the names that she had ever heard, and she sent a messenger over the country to inquire, far and wide, for any other names that there might be. When the manikin came the next day, she began with caspar, melchior, balthazar, and said all the names she knew, one after another, but to every one the little man said, that is not my name.  On the second day she had inquiries made in the neighborhood as to the names of the people there, and she repeated to the manikin the most uncommon and curious.  Perhaps your name is shortribs, or sheepshanks, or laceleg, but he always answered, that is not my name.  On the third day the messenger came back again, and said, I have not been able to find a single new name, but as I came to a high mountain at the end of the forest, where the fox and the hare bid each other good night, there I saw a little house, and before the house a fire was burning, and round about the fire quite a ridiculous little man was jumping, he hopped upon one leg, and shouted -           to-day I bake, to-morrow brew,           the next I;ll have the young queen child.           Ha, glad am I that no one knew           that Rumpelstiltskin I am styled.  You may imagine how glad the queen was when she heard the name.  And when soon afterwards the little man came in, and asked, now, mistress queen, what is my name, at first she said, is your name Conrad?  No.  Is your name Harry?  No. Perhaps your name is Rumpelstiltskin?  The devil has told you that!  The devil has told you that, cried the little man, and in his anger he plunged his right foot so deep into the earth that his whole leg went in, and then in rage he pulled at his left leg so hard with both hands that he tore himself in two. There was once upon a time a king who had twelve daughters, each one more beautiful than the other.  They all slept together in one chamber, in which their beds stood side by side, and every night when they were in them the king locked the door, and bolted it.  But in the morning when he unlocked the door, he saw that their shoes were worn out with dancing, and no one could find out how that had come to pass.  Then the king caused it to be proclaimed that whosoever could discover where they danced at night, should choose one of them for his wife and be king after his death, but that whosoever came forward and had not discovered it within three days and nights, should have forfeited his life.  It was not long before a king son presented himself, and offered to undertake the enterprise. He was well received, and in the evening was led into a room adjoining the princesses, sleeping-chamber.  His bed was placed there, and he was to observe where they went and danced, and in order that they might do nothing secretly or go away to some other place, the door of their room was left open. But the eyelids of the prince grew heavy as lead, and he fell asleep, and when he awoke in the morning, all twelve had been to the dance, for their shoes were standing there with holes in the soles.  On the second and third nights there was no difference, and then his head was struck off without mercy.  Many others came after this and undertook the enterprise, but all forfeited their lives.  Now it came to pass that a poor soldier, who had a wound, and could serve no longer, found himself on the road to the town where the king lived.  There he met an old woman, who asked him where he was going.  "I hardly know myself," answered he, and added in jest, "I had half a mind to discover where the princesses danced their shoes into holes, and thus become king." "That is not so difficult," said the old woman, "you must not drink the wine which will be brought to you at night, and must pretend to be sound asleep." With that she gave him a little cloak, and said, "If you wear this, you will be invisible, and then you can steal after the twelve." When the soldier had received this good advice, he fell to in earnest, took heart, went to the king, and announced himself as a suitor.  He was as well received as the others, and royal garments were put upon him.  He was conducted that evening at bed-time into the antechamber, and as he was about to go to bed, the eldest came and brought him a cup of wine, but he had tied a sponge under his chin, and let the wine run down into it, without drinking a drop.  Then he lay down and when he had lain a while, he began to snore, as if in the deepest sleep.  The twelve princesses heard that, and laughed, and the eldest said, "He, too, might as well have saved his life." With that they got up, opened wardrobes, presses, cupboards, and brought out pretty dresses, dressed themselves before the mirrors, sprang about, and rejoiced at the prospect of the dance. Only the youngest said, "I know not how it is, you are very happy, but I feel very strange, some misfortune is certainly about to befall us." "You are a goose, who are always frightened," said the eldest. "Have you forgotten how many kings; sons have already come here in vain.  I had hardly any need to give the soldier a sleeping-draught, the booby would not have awakened anyway."  When they were all ready they looked carefully at the soldier, but he had closed his eyes and did not move or stir, so they felt themselves safe enough.  The eldest then went to her bed and tapped it, whereupon it immediately sank into the earth, and one after the other they descended through the opening, the eldest going first.  The soldier, who had watched everything, tarried no longer, put on his little cloak, and went down last with the youngest.  Half-way down the steps, he just trod a little on her dress, she was terrified at that, and cried out, "What is that?  Who is pulling my dress?" "Don;t be so silly," said the eldest, "you have caught it on a nail."  Then they went all the way down, and when they were at the bottom, they were standing in a wonderfully pretty avenue of trees, all the leaves of which were of silver, and shone and glistened. The soldier thought, "I must carry a token away with me," and broke off a twig from one of them, on which the tree cracked with a loud report.  The youngest cried out again.  "Something is wrong, did you hear the crack?" But the eldest said, "It is a gun fired for joy, because we have got rid of our prince so quickly." After that they came into an avenue where all the leaves were of gold, and lastly into a third where they were of bright diamonds, he broke off a twig from each, which made such a crack each time that the youngest started back in terror, but the eldest still maintained that they were salutes.  They went on and came to a great lake whereon stood twelve little boats, and in every boat sat a handsome prince, all of whom were waiting for the twelve, and each took one of them with him, but the soldier seated himself by the youngest.  Then her prince said, "I wonder why the boat is so much heavier to-day. I shall have to row with all my strength, if I am to get it across." "What should cause that," said the youngest, "but the warm weather?" "I feel very warm too." On the opposite side of the lake stood a splendid, brightly-lit castle, from whence resounded the joyous music of trumpets and kettle-drums.  They rowed there, entered, and each prince danced with the girl he loved, but the soldier danced with them unseen, and when one of them had a cup of wine in her hand he drank it up, so that the cup was empty when she carried it to her mouth, the youngest was alarmed at this, but the eldest always silenced her.  They danced there till three o;clock in the morning when all the shoes were danced into holes, and they were forced to leave off, the princes rowed them back again over the lake, and this time the soldier seated himself by the eldest.  On the shore they took leave of their princes, and promised to return the following night.  When they reached the stairs the soldier ran on in front and lay down in his bed, and when the twelve had come up slowly and wearily, he was already snoring so loudly that they could all hear him, and they said, "So far as he is concerned, we are safe." They took off their beautiful dresses, laid them away, put the worn-out shoes under the bed, and lay down.  Next morning the soldier was resolved not to speak, but to watch the wonderful goings-on, and again went with them a second and a third night.  Then everything was just as it had been the first time, and each time they danced until their shoes were worn to pieces.  But the third time he took a cup away with him as a token.  When the hour had arrived for him to give his answer, he took the three twigs and the cup, and went to the king, but the twelve stood behind the door, and listened for what he was going to say.  When the king put the question, "Where have my twelve daughters danced their shoes to pieces in the night?" He answered, "In an underground castle with twelve princes," and related how it had come to pass, and brought out the tokens.  The king then summoned his daughters, and asked them if the soldier had told the truth, and when they saw that they were betrayed, and that falsehood would be of no avail, they were obliged to confess all.  Thereupon the king asked which of them he would have to wife.  He answered, "I am no longer young, so give me the eldest." Then the wedding was celebrated on the self-same day, and the kingdom was promised him after the king death.  But the princes were bewitched for as many days as they had danced nights with the twelve. Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs  Once upon a time in the middle of winter, when the flakes of snow were falling like feathers from the sky, a queen sat at a window sewing, and the frame of the window was made of black ebony.  And whilst she was sewing and looking out of the window at the snow, she pricked her finger with the needle, and three drops of blood fell upon the snow.  And the red looked pretty upon the white snow, and she thought to herself, would that I had a child as white as snow, as red as blood, and as black as the wood of the window-frame.  Soon after that she had a little daughter, who was as white as snow, and as red as blood, and her hair was as black as ebony, and she was therefore called little snow-white.  And when the child was born, the queen died.  After a year had passed the king took to himself another wife. She was a beautiful woman, but proud and haughty, and she could not bear that anyone else chould surpass her in beauty.  She had a wonderful looking glass, and when she stood in front of it and looked at herself in it, and said, looking glass, looking glass, on the wall, who in this land is the fairest of all.  The looking glass answered,           thou, o queen, art the fairest of all.  Then she was satisfied, for she knew that the looking glass spoke the truth.  But snow-white was growing up, and grew more and more beautiful, and when she was seven years old she was as beautiful as the day, and more beautiful than the queen herself.  And once when the queen asked her looking glass, looking glass, looking glass, on the wall, who in this land is the fairest of all.  It answered, thou art fairer than all who are here, lady queen. But more beautiful still is snow-white, as I ween.  Then the queen was shocked, and turned yellow and green with envy.  From that hour, whenever she looked at snow-white, her heart heaved in her breast, she hated the girl so much. And envy and pride grew higher and higher in her heart like a weed, so that she had no peace day or night.  She called a huntsman, and said, take the child away into the forest.  I will no longer have her in my sight.  Kill her, and bring me back her lung and liver as a token.  The huntsman obeyed, and took her away but when he had drawn his knife, and was about to pierce snow-white innocent heart, she began to weep, and said, ah dear huntsman, leave me my life.  I will run away into the wild forest, and never come home again.  And as she was so beautiful the huntsman had pity on her and said, run away, then, you poor child.  The wild beasts will soon have devoured you, thought he, and yet it seemed as if a stone had been rolled from his heart since it was no longer needful for him to kill her.  And as a young bear just then came running by he stabbed it, and cut out its lung and liver and took them to the queen as proof that the child was dead.  The cook had to salt them, and the wicked queen ate them, and thought she had eaten the lung and liver of snow-white.  But now the poor child was all alone in the great forest, and so terrified that she looked at all the leaves on the trees, and did not know what to do.  Then she began to run, and ran over sharp stones and through thorns, and the wild beasts ran past her, but did her no harm.  She ran as long as her feet would go until it was almost evening, then she saw a little cottage and went into it to rest herself. Everything in the cottage was small, but neater and cleaner than can be told.  There was a table on which was a white cover, and seven little plates, and on each plate a little spoon, moreover, there were seven little knives and forks, and seven little mugs. Against the wall stood seven little beds side by side, and covered with snow-white counterpanes.  Little snow-white was so hungry and thirsty that she ate some vegetables and bread from each plate and drank a drop of wine out of each mug, for she did not wish to take all from one only. Then, as she was so tired, she laid herself down on one of the little beds, but none of them suited her, one was too long, another too short, but at last she found that the seventh one was right, and so she remained in it, said a prayer and went to sleep.  When it was quite dark the owners of the cottage came back. They were seven dwarfs who dug and delved in the mountains for ore.  They lit their seven candles, and as it was now light within the cottage they saw that someone had been there, for everything was not in the same order in which they had left it.  The first said, who has been sitting on my chair. The second, who has been eating off my plate. The third, who has been taking some of my bread. The fourth, who has been eating my vegetables. The fifth, who has been using my fork. The sixth, who has been cutting with my knife. The seventh, who has been drinking out of my mug.  Then the first looked round and saw that there was a little hollow on his bed, and he said, who has been getting into my bed.  The others came up and each called out, somebody has been lying in my bed too.  But the seventh when he looked at his bed saw little snow-white, who was lying asleep therein.  And he called the others, who came running up, and they cried out with astonishment, and brought their seven little candles and let the light fall on little snow-white.  Oh, heavens, oh, heavens, cried they, what a lovely child.  And they were so glad that they did not wake her up, but let her sleep on in the bed.  And the seventh dwarf slept with his companions, one hour with each, and so passed the night.  When it was morning little snow-white awoke, and was frightened when she saw the seven dwarfs.  But they were friendly and asked her what her name was.  My name is snow-white, she answered. How have you come to our house, said the dwarfs.  Then she told them that her step-mother had wished to have her killed, but that the huntsman had spared her life, and that she had run for the whole day, until at last she had found their dwelling.  The dwarfs said, if you will take care of our house, cook, make the beds, wash, sew and knit, and if you will keep everything neat and clean you can stay with us and you shall want for nothing. Yes, said snow-white, with all my heart.  And she stayed with them.  She kept the house in order for them.  In the mornings they went to the mountains and looked for copper and gold, in the evenings they came back, and then their supper had to be ready. The girl was alone the whole day, so the good dwarfs warned her and said, beware of your step-mother, she will soon know that you are here, be sure to let no one come in.  But the queen, believing that she had eaten snow-white lung and liver, could not but think that she was again the first and most beautiful of all, and she went to her looking glass and said, looking glass, looking glass, on the wall, who in this land is the fairest of all.  And the glass answered, oh, queen, thou art fairest of all I see,           but over the hills, where the seven dwarfs dwell, snow-white is still alive and well, and none is so fair as she.  Then she was astounded, for she knew that the looking glass never spoke falsely, and she knew that the huntsman had betrayed her, and that little snow-white was still alive.  And so she thought and thought again how she might kill her, for so long as she was not the fairest in the whole land, envy let her have no rest.  And when she had at last thought of something to do, she painted her face, and dressed herself like an old pedlar-woman, and no one could have known her.  In this disguise she went over the seven mountains to the seven dwarfs, and knocked at the door and cried, pretty things to sell, very cheap, very cheap.  Little snow-white looked out of the window and called out, good-day my good woman, what have you to sell.  Good things, pretty things, she answered, stay-laces of all colors, and she pulled out one which was woven of bright-colored silk.  I may let the worthy old woman in, thought snow-white, and she unbolted the door and bought the pretty laces.  Child, said the old woman, what a fright you look, come, I will lace you properly for once. Snow-white had no suspicion, but stood before her, and let herself be laced with the new laces.  But the old woman laced so quickly and so tightly that snow-white lost her breath and fell down as if dead.  Now I am the most beautiful, said the queen to herself, and ran away.  Not long afterwards, in the evening, the seven dwarfs came home, but how shocked they were when they saw their dear little snow-white lying on the ground, and that she neither stirred nor moved, and seemed to be dead.  They lifted her up, and, as they saw that she was laced too tightly, they cut the laces, then she began to breathe a little, and after a while came to life again. When the dwarfs heard what had happened they said, the old pedlar-woman was no one else than the wicked queen, take care and let no one come in when we are not with you.  But the wicked woman when she had reached home went in front of the glass and asked,           looking glass, looking glass, on the wall,           who in this land is the fairest of all.  And it answered as before,           oh, queen, thou art fairest of all I see,           but over the hills, where the seven dwarfs dwell,           snow-white is still alive and well,           and none is so fair as she.  When she heard that, all her blood rushed to her heart with fear, for she saw plainly that little snow-white was again alive. But now, she said, I will think of something that shall really put an end to you.  And by the help of witchcraft, which she understood, she made a poisonous comb.  Then she disguised herself and took the shape of another old woman.  So she went over the seven mountains to the seven dwarfs, knocked at the door, and cried, good things to sell, cheap, cheap.  Little snow-white looked out and said, go away, I cannot let anyone come in.  I suppose you can look, said the old woman, and pulled the poisonous comb out and held it up.  It pleased the girl so well that she let herself be beguiled, and opened the door.  When they had made a bargain the old woman said, now I will comb you properly for once.  Poor little snow-white had no suspicion, and let the old woman do as she pleased, but hardly had she put the comb in her hair than the poison in it took effect, and the girl fell down senseless.  You paragon of beauty, said the wicked woman, you are done for now, and she went away.  But fortunately it was almost evening, when the seven dwarfs came home.  When they saw snow-white lying as if dead upon the ground they at once suspected the step-mother, and they looked and found the poisoned comb.  Scarcely had they taken it out when snow-white came to herself, and told them what had happened. Then they warned her once more to be upon her guard and to open the door to no one.  The queen, at home, went in front of the glass and said,           looking glass, looking glass, on the wall,           who in this land is the fairest of all.  Then it answered as before,           oh, queen, thou art fairest of all I see,           but over the hills, where the seven dwarfs dwell,           snow-white is still alive and well,           and none is so fair as she.  When she heard the glass speak thus she trembled and shook with rage.  Snow-white shall die, she cried, even if it costs me my life.  Thereupon she went into a quite secret, lonely room, where no one ever came, and there she made a very poisonous apple. Outside it looked pretty, white with a red cheek, so that everyone who saw it longed for it, but whoever ate a piece of it must surely die.  When the apple was ready she painted her face, and dressed herself up as a farmer wife, and so she went over the seven mountains to the seven dwarfs.  She knocked at the door.  Snow-white put her head out of the window and said, I cannot let anyone in, the seven dwarfs have forbidden me.  It is all the same to me, answered the woman, I shall soon get rid of my apples. There, I will give you one.  No, said snow-white, I dare not take anything.  Are you afraid of poison, said the old woman, look, I will cut the apple in two pieces, you eat the red cheek, and I will eat the white.  The apple was so cunningly made that only the red cheek was poisoned.  Snow-white longed for the fine apple, and when she saw that the woman ate part of it she could resist no longer, and stretched out her hand and took the poisonous half.  But hardly had she a bit of it in her mouth than she fell down dead.  Then the queen looked at her with a dreadful look, and laughed aloud and said, white as snow, red as blood, black as ebony-wood, this time the dwarfs cannot wake you up again.  And when she asked of the looking glass at home,           looking glass, looking glass, on the wall,           who in this land is the fairest of all.  And it answered at last,           oh, queen, in this land thou art fairest of all. Then her envious heart had rest, so far as an envious heart can have rest.  The dwarfs, when they came home in the evening, found snow-white lying upon the ground, she breathed no longer and was dead. They lifted her up, looked to see whether they could find anything poisonous, unlaced her, combed her hair, washed her with water and wine, but it was all of no use, the poor child was dead, and remained dead.  They laid her upon a bier, and all seven of them sat round it and wept for her, and wept three days long.  Then they were going to bury her, but she still looked as if she were living, and still had her pretty red cheeks.  They said, we could not bury her in the dark ground, and they had a transparent coffin of glass made, so that she could be seen from all sides, and they laid her in it, and wrote her name upon it in golden letters, and that she was a king daughter.  Then they put the coffin out upon the mountain, and one of them always stayed by it and watched it.  And birds came too, and wept for snow-white, first an owl, then a raven, and last a dove.  And now snow-white lay a long, long time in the coffin, and she did not change, but looked as if she were asleep, for she was as white as snow, as red as blood, and her hair was as black as ebony.  It happened, however, that a king son came into the forest, and went to the dwarfs, house to spend the night.  He saw the coffin on the mountain, and the beautiful snow-white within it, and read what was written upon it in golden letters.  Then he said to the dwarfs, let me have the coffin, I will give you whatever you want for it.  But the dwarfs answered, we will not part with it for all the gold in the world.  Then he said, let me have it as a gift, for I cannot live without seeing snow-white.  I will honor and prize her as my dearest possession.  As he spoke in this way the good dwarfs took pity upon him, and gave him the coffin.  And now the king son had it carried away by his servants on their shoulders.  And it happened that they stumbled over a tree-stump, and with the shock the poisonous piece of apple which snow-white had bitten off came out of her throat.  And before long she opened her eyes, lifted up the lid of the coffin, sat up, and was once more alive.  Oh, heavens, where am I, she cried.  The king son, full of joy, said, you are with me.  And told her what had happened, and said, I love you more than everything in the world, come with me to my father palace, you shall be my wife.  And snow-white was willing, and went with him, and their wedding was held with great show and splendor.  But snow-white wicked step-mother was also bidden to the feast.  When she had arrayed herself in beautiful clothes she went before the looking glass, and said,           looking glass, looking glass, on the wall,           who in this land is the fairest of all.  The glass answered,           oh, queen, of all here the fairest art thou,           but the young queen is fairer by far as I trow.  Then the wicked woman uttered a curse, and was so wretched, so utterly wretched that she knew not what to do.  At first she would not go to the wedding at all, but she had no peace, and had to go to see the young queen.  And when she went in she recognized snow-white, and she stood still with rage and fear, and could not stir.  But iron slippers had already been put upon the fire, and they were brought in with tongs, and set before her.  Then she was forced to put on the red-hot shoes, and dance until she dropped down dead. There was once a girl whose father and mother died while she was still a little child.  All alone, in a small house at the end of the village, dwelt her godmother, who supported herself by spinning, weaving, and sewing.  The old woman took the forlorn child to live with her, kept her to her work, and educated her in all that is good.  When the girl was fifteen years old, the old woman became ill, called the child to her bedside, and said, dear daughter, I feel my end drawing near.  I leave you the little house, which will protect you from wind and weather, and my spindle, shuttle, and needle, with which you can earn your bread.  Then she laid her hands on the girl head, blessed her, and said, only preserve the love of God in your heart, and all will go well with you.  Thereupon she closed her eyes, and when she was laid in the earth, the maiden followed the coffin, weeping bitterly, and paid her the last mark of respect. And now the maiden lived quite alone in the little house, and was industrious, and spun, wove, and sewed, and the blessing of the good old woman was on all that she did.  It seemed as if the flax in the room increased of its own accord, and whenever she wove a piece of cloth or carpet, or had made a shirt, she at once found a buyer who paid her amply for it, so that she was in want of nothing, and even had something to share with others. About this time, the son of the king was traveling about the country looking for a bride.  He was not to choose a poor one, and did not want to have a rich one.  So he said, she shall be my wife who is the poorest, and at the same time the richest.  When he came to the village where the maiden dwelt, he inquired, as he did wherever he went, who was the richest and also the poorest girl in the place.  They first named the richest.  The poorest, they said, was the girl who lived in the small house quite at the end of the village.  The rich girl was sitting in all her splendor before the door of her house, and when the prince approached her, she got up, went to meet him, and made him a low curtsy.  He looked at her, said nothing, and rode on.  When he came to the house of the poor girl, she was not standing at the door, but sitting in her little room.  He stopped his horse, and saw through the window, on which the bright sun was shining, the girl sitting at her spinning-wheel, busily spinning.  She looked up, and when she saw that the prince was looking in, she blushed all over her face, let her eyes fall, and went on spinning.  I do not know whether, just at that moment, the thread was quite even, but she went on spinning until the king son had ridden away again.  Then she went to the window, opened it, and said, it is so warm in this room, and she looked after him as long as she could distinguish the white feathers in his hat.  Then she sat down to work again in her room and went on with her spinning, and a saying which the old woman had often repeated when she was sitting at her work, came into her mind, and she sang these words to herself,      spindle, my spindle, haste, haste thee away,      and here to my house bring the wooer, I pray. And what do you think happened.  The spindle sprang out of her hand in an instant, and out of the door, and when, in her astonishment, she got up and looked after it, she saw that it was dancing out merrily into the open country, and drawing a shining gold thread after it.  Before long, it had entirely vanished from her sight.  As she had now no spindle, the girl took the weaver shuttle in her hand, sat down to her loom, and began to weave. The spindle, however, danced continually onwards, and just as the thread came to an end, reached the prince.  What do I see, he cried, the spindle certainly wants to show me the way, turned his horse about, and rode back with the golden thread.  The girl however, was sitting at her work singing,      shuttle, my shuttle, weave well this day,      and guide the wooer to me, I pray. Immediately the shuttle sprang out of her hand and out by the door. Before the threshold, however, it began to weave a carpet which was more beautiful than the eyes of man had ever yet beheld. Lilies and roses blossomed on both sides of it, and on a golden ground in the center green branches ascended, under which bounded hares and rabbits, stags and deer stretched their heads in between them, brightly-colored birds were sitting in the branches above, they lacked nothing but the gift of song.  The shuttle leapt hither and thither, and everything seemed to grow of its own accord. As the shuttle had run away, the girl sat down to sew.  She held the needle in her hand and sang,      needle, my needle, sharp-pointed and fine,      prepare for the wooer this house of mine. Then the needle leapt out of her fingers, and flew everywhere about the room as quick as lightning.  It was just as if invisible spirits were working, it covered tables and benches with green cloth in an instant, and the chairs with velvet, and hung the windows with silken curtains.  Hardly had the needle put in the last stitch than the maiden saw through the window the white feathers of the prince, whom the spindle had brought thither by the golden thread.  He alighted, stepped over the carpet into the house, and when he entered the room, there stood the maiden in her poor garments, but she shone out from within them like a rose surrounded by leaves. You are the poorest and also the richest, said he to her.  Come with me, you shall be my bride.  She did not speak, but she gave him her hand.  Then he gave her a kiss, led her forth, lifted her on to his horse, and took her to the royal castle, where the wedding was solemnized with great rejoicings.  The spindle, shuttle, and needle were preserved in the treasure-chamber, and held in great honor. There was once a poor woodcutter who toiled from early morning till late at night.  When at last he had laid by some money he said to his boy, "You are my only child, I will spend the money which I have earned with the sweat of my brow on your education, if you learn some honest trade you can support me in my old age, when my limbs have grown stiff and I am obliged to stay at home."  Then the boy went to a high school and learned diligently so that his masters praised him, and he remained there a long time.  When he had worked through two classes, but was still not yet perfect in everything, the little pittance which the father had earned was all spent, and the boy was obliged to return home to him.  "Ah," said the father, sorrowfully, "I can give you no more, and in these hard times I cannot earn a farthing more than will suffice for our daily bread."  "Dear father," answered the son, "don;t trouble yourself about it, if it is God will, it will turn to my advantage.  I shall soon accustom myself to it."  When the father wanted to go into the forest to earn money by helping to chop and stack wood, the son said, "I will go with you and help you."  "Nay, my son," said the father, "that would be hard for you.  You are not accustomed to rough work, and will not be able to bear it.  Besides, I have only one axe and no money left wherewith to buy another."  "Just go to the neighbor," answered the son, "he will lend you his axe until I have earned one for myself."  The father then borrowed an axe of the neighbor, and next morning at break of day they went out into the forest together. The son helped his father and was quite merry and brisk about it.  But when the sun was right over their heads, the father said, "We will rest, and have our dinner, and then we shall work twice as well."  The son took his bread in his hands, and said, "Just you rest, father, I am not tired, I will walk up and down a little in the forest, and look for birds; nests."  "Oh, you fool," said the father, "why should you want to run about there?  Afterwards you will be tired, and no longer able to raise your arm. Stay here, and sit down beside me."  The son, however, went into the forest, ate his bread, was very merry and peered in among the green branches to see if he could discover a bird nest anywhere.  So he walked to and fro until at last he came to a great dangerous-looking oak, which certainly was already many hundred years old, and which five men could not have spanned.  He stood still and looked at it, and thought, many a bird must have built its nest in that.  Then all at once it seemed to him that he heard a voice.  He listened and became aware that someone was crying in a very smothered voice, "Let me out, let me out."  He looked around, but could discover nothing.  Then he fancied that the voice came out of the ground. So he cried, "Where are you?"  The voice answered, "I am down here amongst the roots of the oak-tree.  Let me out.  Let me out."  The schoolboy began to loosen the earth under the tree, and search among the roots, until at last he found a glass bottle in a little hollow.  He lifted it up and held it against the light, and then saw a creature shaped like a frog, springing up and down in it. "Let me out.  Let me out," it cried anew, and the boy thinking no evil, drew the cork out of the bottle.  Immediately a spirit ascended from it, and began to grow, and grew so fast that in a very few moments he stood before the boy, a terrible fellow as big as half the tree.  "Do you know," he cried in an awful voice, "what your reward is for having let me out?"  "No," replied the boy fearlessly, "how should I know that?"  "Then I will tell you," cried the spirit, "I must strangle you for it."  "You should have told me that sooner," said the boy, "for I should then have left you shut up, but my head shall stand fast for all you can do, more persons than one must be consulted about that."  "More persons here, more persons there," said the spirit.  "You shall have the reward you have earned.  Do you think that I was shut up there for such a long time as a favor.  No, it was a punishment for me.  I am the mighty Mercurius.  Whoso releases me, him must I strangle." "Slowly," answered the boy, "not so fast.  I must first know that you really were shut up in that little bottle, and that you are the right spirit.  If, indeed, you can get in again, I will believe and then you may do as you will with me."  The spirit said haughtily, "that is a very trifling feat."  Drew himself together, and made himself as small and slender as he had been at first, so that he crept through the same opening, and right through the neck of the bottle in again.  Scarcely was he within than the boy thrust the cork he had drawn back into the bottle, and threw it among the roots of the oak into its old place, and the spirit was deceived.  And now the schoolboy was about to return to his father, but the spirit cried very piteously, "Ah, do let me out, ah, do let me out." "No," answered the boy, "not a second time.  He who has once tried to take my life shall not be set free by me, now that I have caught him again."  "If you will set me free," said the spirit, "I will give you so much that you will have plenty all the days of your life." "No," answered the boy, "you would cheat me as you did the first time." "You are spurning you own good luck," said the spirit, "I will do you no harm but will reward you richly."  The boy thought, "I will venture it, perhaps he will keep his word, and anyhow he shall not get the better of me."  Then he took out the cork, and the spirit rose up from the bottle as he had done before, stretched himself out and became as big as a giant.  "Now you shall have your reward," said he, and handed the boy a little rag just like stiking-plaster, and said, "If you spread one end of this over a wound it will heal, and if you rub steel or iron with the other end it will be changed into silver."  "I must just try that," said the boy, and went to a tree, tore off the bark with his axe, and rubbed it with one end of the plaster.  It immediately closed together and was healed.  "Now, it is all right," he said to the spirit, "and we can part."  The spirit thanked him for his release, and the boy thanked the spirit for his present, and went back to his father.  "Where have you been racing about?" said the father.  "Why have you forgotten your work?  I always said that you would never come to anything."  "Be easy, father, I will make it up."  "Make it up indeed," said the father angrily, "that no use."  "Take care, father, I will soon hew that tree there, so that it will split."  Then he took his plaster, rubbed the axe with it, and dealt a mighty blow, but as the iron had changed into silver, the edge bent.  "Hi, father, just look what a bad axe you;ve given me, it has become quite crooked."  The father was shocked and said, "Ah, what have you done! Now I shall have to pay for that, and have not the wherewithal, and that is all the good I have got by your work."  "Don;t get angry," said the son, "I will soon pay for the axe." "Oh, you blockhead," cried the father, "Wherewith will you pay for it? You have nothing but what I give you.  These are students; tricks that are sticking in your head, you have no idea of woodcutting."  After a while the boy said, "Father, I can really work no more, we had better take a holiday."  "Eh, what," answered he, "do you think I will sit with my hands lying in my lap like you.  I must go on working, but you may take yourself off home."  "Father, I am here in this wood for the first time, I don;t know my way alone.  Do go with me."  As his anger had now abated, the father at last let himself be persuaded and went home with him. Then he said to the son, "Go and sell your damaged axe, and see what you can get for it, and I must earn the difference, in order to pay the neighbor."  The son took the axe, and carried it into town to a goldsmith, who tested it, laid it in the scales, and said, "It is worth four hundred talers, I have not so much as that by me."  The son said, "Give me what thou have, I will lend you the rest."  The goldsmith gave him three hundred talers, and remained a hundred in his debt.  The son thereupon went home and said, "Father, I have got the money, go and ask the neighbor what he wants for the axe." "I know that already," answered the old man, "one taler, six groschen." "Then give him him two talers, twelve groschen, that is double and enough.  See, I have money in plenty."  And he gave the father a hundred talers, and said, "You shall never know want, live as comfortably as you like."  "Good heavens," said the father, "how have you come by these riches?"  The boy then told how all had come to pass, and how he, trusting in his luck, had made such a packet. But with the money that was left, he went back to the high school and went on learning more, and as he could heal all wounds with his plaster, he became the most famous doctor in the whole world. There were once a man and a woman who had an only child, and lived quite alone in a solitary valley.  It came to pass that the mother once went into the wood to gather branches of fir, and took with her little Hans, who was just two years old.  As it was spring-time, and the child took pleasure in the many-colored flowers, she went still further onwards with him into the forest. Suddenly two robbers sprang out of the thicket, seized the mother and child, and carried them far away into the black forest, where no one ever came from one year end to another.  The poor woman urgently begged the robbers to set her and her child free, but their hearts were made of stone, they would not listen to her prayers and entreaties, and drove her on farther by force.  After they had worked their way through bushes and briars for about two miles, they came to a rock where there was a door, at which the robbers knocked and it opened at once.  They had to go through a long dark passage, which burnt on the hearth.  On the wall hung swords, sabres, and other deadly weapons which gleamed in the light, and in the midst stood a black table at which four other robbers were sitting gambling, and the captain sat at the head of it.  As soon as he saw the woman he came and spoke to her, and told her to be at ease and have no fear, they would do nothing to hurt her, but she must look after the housekeeping, and if she kept everything in order, she should not fare ill with them. Thereupon they gave her something to eat, and showed her a bed where she might sleep with her child. The woman stayed many years with the robbers, and Hans grew tall and strong.  His mother told him stories, and taught him to read an old book of tales about knights which she found in the cave.  When Hans was nine years old, he made himself a strong club out of a branch of fir, hid it behind the bed, and then went to his mother and said, dear mother, pray tell me who is my father.  I must and will know.  His mother was silent and would not tell him, that he might not become home-sick.  Moreover she knew that the godless robbers would not let him go away, but it almost broke her heart that Hans should not go to his father. In the night, when the robbers came home from their robbing expedition, Hans brought out his club, stood before the captain, and said, I now wish to know who my father is, and if you do not tell me at once I will strike you down.  Then the captain laughed, and gave Hans such a box on the ear that he rolled under the table. Hans got up again, held his tongue, and thought, I will wait another year and then try again, perhaps I shall do better then. When the year was over, he brought out his club again, rubbed the dust off it, looked at it well, and said, it is a stout strong club.  At night the robbers came home, drank one jug of wine after another, and their heads began to be heavy.  Then Hans brought out his club, placed himself before the captain, and asked him who his father was.  But the captain again gave him such a vigorous box on the ear that Hans rolled under the table.  However, it was not long before he was up again, and so beat the captain and the robbers with his club, that they could no longer move either their arms or their legs. His mother stood in a corner full of admiration for his bravery and strength.  When Hans had done his work, he went to his mother, and said, now I have shown myself to be in earnest, but now I must also know who my father is.  Dear Hans, answered the mother, come, we will go and seek him until we find him.  She took from the captain the key to the entrance-door, and Hans fetched a great meal-sack and packed into it gold and silver, and whatsoever else he could find that was beautiful, until it was full, and then he took it on his back.  They left the cave, but how Hans did open his eyes when he came out of the darkness into daylight, and saw the green forest, and the flowers, and the birds, and the morning sun in the sky.  He stood there and wondered at everything just as if he were not quite right in the head.  His mother looked for the way home, and when they had walked for a couple of hours, they got safely into their lonely valley and to their little house.  The father was sitting in the doorway.  He wept for joy when he recognized his wife and heard that Hans was his son, for he had long regarded them both as dead.  But Hans, although he was not twelve years old, was a head taller than his father.  They went into the little room together, but Hans had scarcely put his sack on the bench by the stove, than the whole house began to crack - the bench broke down and then the floor, and the heavy sack fell through into the cellar.  God save us, cried the father, what that.  Now you have broken our little house to pieces.  Don;t let that turn your hair grey, dear father, answered Hans.  There, in that sack, is more than is wanting for a new house.  The father and Hans at once began to build a new house, to buy cattle and land, and to keep a farm.  Hans ploughed the fields, and when he followed the plough and pushed it into the ground, the bullocks had scarcely any need to draw. The next spring, Hans said, keep all the money and have made for me a walking-stick that weighs a hundred-weight, that I may go a-traveling.  When the stick was ready, he left his father house, went forth, and came to a deep, dark forest.  There he heard something crunching and cracking, looked round, and saw a fir-tree which was wound round like a rope from the bottom to the top, and when he looked upwards he saw a great fellow who had laid hold of the tree and was twisting it like a willow-wand. Hullo, cried Hans, what are you doing up there.  The fellow replied, I got some faggots together yesterday and am twisting a rope for them.  That is what I like, thought Hans, he has some strength, and he called to him, leave that alone, and come with me.  The fellow came down, and he was taller by a whole head than Hans, and Hans was not little.  Your name is now fir-twister, said Hans to him.  Thereupon they went further and heard something knocking and hammering with such force that the ground shook at every stroke.  Shortly afterwards they came to a mighty rock, before which a giant was standing and striking great pieces of it away with his fist.  When Hans asked what he was doing, he answered, at night, when I want to sleep, bears, wolves, and other vermin of that kind come, which sniff and snuffle about me and won;t let me rest, so I want to build myself a house and lay myself inside it, so that I may have some peace.  Oh indeed, thought Hans, I can make use of this one also, and said to him, leave your house-building alone, and go with me.  You shall be called rock-splitter.  The man consented, and they all three roamed through the forest, and wherever they went the wild beasts were terrified, and ran away from them.  In the evening they came to an old deserted castle, went up into it, and laid themselves down in the hall to sleep.  The next morning Hans went into the garden.  It had run quite wild, and was full of thorns and brambles.  And as he was thus walking round about, a wild boar rushed at him, he, however, gave it such a blow with his club that it fell directly.  He took it on his shoulders and carried it in, and they put it on a spit, roasted it, and enjoyed themselves. Then they arranged that each day, in turn, two should go out hunting, and one should stay at home, and cook nine pounds of meat for each of them.  Fir-twister stayed at home the first, and Hans and rock-splitter went out hunting.  When fir-twister was busy cooking, a little shrivelled-up old mannikin came to him in the castle, and asked for some meat.  Be off, you sneaking imp, he answered, you need no meat.  But how astonished fir-twister was when the little insignificant dwarf sprang up at him, and belabored him so with his fists that he could not defend himself, but fell on the ground and gasped for breath.  The dwarf did not go away until he had thoroughly vented his anger on him. When the two others came home from hunting, fir-twister said nothing to them of the old mannikin and of the blows which he himself had received, and thought, when they stay at home, they may just try their  chance with the little scrubbing-brush, and the mere thought of that gave him pleasure already. The next day rock-splitter stayed at home, and he fared just as fir-twister had done, being very ill-treated by the dwarf because he was not willing to give him any meat.  When the others came home in the evening, fir-twister saw clearly what he had suffered, but both kept silence, and thought, Hans also must taste some of that soup. Hans, who had to stay at home the next day, did his work in the kitchen as it had to be done, and as he was standing skimming the pan, the dwarf came and without more ado demanded a piece of meat.  Then Hans thought, he is a poor wretch, I will give him some of my share, that the others may not run short, and handed him a bit.  When the dwarf had devoured it, he again asked for some meat, and good-natured Hans gave it to him, and told him it was a handsome piece, and that he was to be content with it.  But the dwarf begged again for the third time.  You are shameless, said Hans, and gave him none.  Then the malicious dwarf wanted to spring on him and treat him as he had treated fir-twister and rock-splitter, but he had chosen the wrong man.  Hans, without exerting himself much, gave him a couple of blows which made him jump down the castle steps.  Hans was about to run after him, but fell right over, flat on his face.  When he rose up again, the dwarf had got the start of him.  Hans hurried after him as far as the forest, and saw him slip into a hole in the rock.  Hans now went home, but he had marked the spot.  When the two others came back, they were surprised that Hans was so well.  He told them what had happened, and then they no longer concealed how it had fared with them.  Hans laughed and said, it served you quite right.  Why were you so mean with your meat.  It is a disgrace that you who are so big should have let yourselves be beaten by the dwarf.  Thereupon they took a basket and a rope, and all three went to the hole in the rock into which the dwarf had slipped, and let Hans and his club down in the basket.  When Hans had reached the bottom, he found a door, and when he opened it a maiden was sitting there who was lovely as any picture, nay, so beautiful that no words can express it, and by her side sat the dwarf and grinned at Hans like a sea-cat.  She, however, was bound with chains, and looked so mournfully at him that Hans felt great pity for her, and thought to himself, you must deliver her out of the power of the wicked dwarf, and gave him such a blow with his club that he fell down dead.  Immediately the chains fell from the maiden, and Hans was enraptured with her beauty.  She told him she was a king daughter whom a savage count had stolen away from her home, and imprisoned there among the rocks, because she would have nothing to say to him.  The count, however, had set the dwarf as a watchman, and he had made her suffer misery and vexation enough.  And now Hans placed the maiden in the basket and had her drawn up.  The basket came down again, but Hans did not trust his two companions, and thought, they have already shown themselves to be false, and told me nothing about the dwarf.  Who knows what design they may have against me.  So he put his club in the basket, and it was lucky he did, for when the basket was half-way up, they let it fall again, and if Hans had really been sitting in it he would have been killed.  But now he did not know how he was to work his way out of the depths, and when he turned it over and over in his mind he found no counsel.  It is indeed sad, said he to himself, that I have to waste away down here, and as he was thus walking backwards and forwards, he once more came to the little chamber where the maiden had been sitting, and saw that the dwarf had a ring on his finger which shone and sparkled.  Then he drew it off and put it on, and when he turned it round on his finger, he suddenly heard something rustle over his head.  He looked up and saw spirits of the air hovering above, who told him he was their master, and asked what his desire might be.  Hans was at first struck dumb, but afterwards he said that they were to carry him up again.  They obeyed instantly, and it was just as if he had flown up himself. But when he had arrived there, he found no one in sight. Fir-twister and rock-splitter had hurried away, and had taken the beautiful maiden with them. But Hans turned the ring, and the spirits of the air came and told him that the two were on the sea.  Hans ran and ran without stopping, until he came to the sea-shore, and there far, far out on the water, he perceived a little boat in which his faithless comrades were sitting, and in fierce anger he leapt, without thinking what he was doing, club in hand into the water, and began to swim, but the club, which weighed a hundredweight, dragged him deep down until he was all but drowned.  Then in the very nick of time he turned his ring, and immediately the spirits of the air came and bore him as swift as lightning into the boat.  He swung his club and gave his wicked comrades the reward they merited and threw them into the water, and then he sailed with the beautiful maiden, who had been in the greatest alarm, and whom he delivered for the second time, home to her father and mother, and married her, and all rejoiced exceedingly. There was once a man who had seven sons, and still he had no daughter, however much he wished for one.  At length his wife again gave him hope of a child, and when it came into the world it was a girl.  The joy was great, but the child was sickly and small, and had to be privately baptized on account of its weakness.  The father sent one of the boys in haste to the spring to fetch water for the baptism.  The other six went with him, and as each of them wanted to be first to fill it, the jug fell into the well.  There they stood and did not know what to do, and none of them dared to go home.  As they still did not return, the father grew impatient, and said, they have certainly forgotten it while playing some game, the wicked boys.  He became afraid that the girl would have to die without being baptized, and in his anger cried, I wish the boys were all turned into ravens.  Hardly was the word spoken before he heard a whirring of wings over his head, looked up and saw seven coal-black ravens flying away.  The parents could not withdraw the curse, and however sad they were at the loss of their seven sons, they still to some extent comforted themselves with their dear little daughter, who soon grew strong and every day became more beautiful.  For a long time she did not know that she had had brothers, for her parents were careful not to mention them before her, but one day she accidentally heard some people saying of herself, that the girl was certainly beautiful, but that in reality she was to blame for the misfortune which had befallen her seven brothers.  Then she was much troubled, and went to her father and mother and asked if it was true that she had had brothers, and what had become of them.  The parents now dared keep the secret no longer, but said that what had befallen her brothers was the will of heaven, and that her birth had only been the innocent cause.  But the maiden took it to heart daily, and thought she must save her brothers.  She had no rest or peace until she set out secretly, and went forth into the wide world to search for her brothers and set them free, let it cost what it might.  She took nothing with her but a little ring belonging to her parents as a keepsake, a loaf of bread against hunger, a little pitcher of water against thirst, and a little chair as a provision against weariness.  And now she went continually onwards, far, far to the very end of the world.  Then she came to the sun, but it was too hot and terrible, and devoured little children.  Hastily she ran away, and ran to the moon, but it was far too cold, and also awful and malicious, and when it saw the child, it said, I smell, I smell the flesh of men.  At this she ran swiftly away, and came to the stars, which were kind and good to her, and each of them sat on its own particular little chair.  But the morning star arose, and gave her the drumstick of a chicken, and said, if you have not that drumstick you can not open the glass mountain, and in the glass mountain are your brothers.  The maiden took the drumstick, wrapped it carefully in a cloth, and went onwards again until she came to the glass mountain.  The door was shut, and she thought she would take out the drumstick. But when she undid the cloth, it was empty, and she had lost the good star present.  What was she now to do.  She wished to rescue her brothers, and had no key to the glass mountain.  The good sister took a knife, cut off one of her little fingers, put it in the door, and succeeded in opening it.  When she had gone inside, a little dwarf came to meet her, who said, my child, what are you looking for.  I am looking for my brothers, the seven ravens, she replied.  The dwarf said, the lord ravens are not at home, but if you will wait here until they come, step in.  Thereupon the little dwarf carried the ravens; dinner in, on seven little plates, and in seven little glasses, and the little sister ate a morsel from each plate, and from each little glass she took a sip, but in the last little glass she dropped the ring which she had brought away with her.  Suddenly she heard a whirring of wings and a rushing through the air, and then the little dwarf said, now the lord ravens are flying home.  Then they came, and wanted to eat and drink, and looked for their little plates and glasses.  Then said one after the other, who has eaten something from my plate.  Who has drunk out of my little glass.  It was a human mouth.  And when the seventh came to the bottom of the glass, the ring rolled against his mouth.  Then he looked at it, and saw that it was a ring belonging to his father and mother, and said, God grant that our sister may be here, and then we shall be free.  When the maiden, who was standing behind the door watching, heard that wish, she came forth, and on this all the ravens were restored to their human form again.  And they embraced and kissed each other, and went joyfully home. There was once a poor woman who gave birth to a little son, and as he came into the world with a caul on, it was predicted that in his fourteenth year he would have the king daughter for his wife.  It happened that soon afterwards the king came into the village, and no one knew that he was the king, and when he asked the people what news there was, they answered, a child has just been born with a caul on, whatever anyone so born undertakes turns out well.  It is prophesied, too, that in his fourteenth year he will have the king daughter for his wife.  The king, who had a bad heart, and was angry about the prophecy, went to the parents, and, seeming quite friendly, said, you poor people, let me have your child, and I will take care of it.  At first they refused, but when the stranger offered them a large amount of gold for it, and they thought, it is a child of good fortune, and everything must turn out well for it, they at last consented, and gave him the child.  The king put it in a box and rode away with it until he came to a deep piece of water, then he threw the box into it and thought, I have freed my daughter from her undesired suitor.  The box, however, did not sink, but floated like a boat, and not a drop of water made its way into it.  And it floated to within two miles of the king chief city, where there was a mill, and it came to a halt at the mill-dam.  A miller boy, who by good luck was standing there, noticed it and pulled it out with a hook, thinking that he had found a great treasure, but when he opened it there lay a pretty boy inside, quite fresh and lively.  He took him to the miller and his wife, and as they had no children they were glad, and said, "God has given him to us."  They took great care of the foundling, and he grew up in all goodness.  It happened that once in a storm, the king went into the mill, and asked the mill-folk if the tall youth were their son.  No, answered they, he a foundling.  Fourteen years ago he floated down to the mill-dam in a box, and the mill-boy pulled him out of the water.  Then the king knew that it was none other than the child of good fortune which he had thrown into the water, and he said, my good people, could not the youth take a letter to the queen. I will give him two gold pieces as a reward.  Just as the king commands, answered they, and they told the boy to hold himself in readiness.  Then the king wrote a letter to the queen, wherein he said, as soon as the boy arrives with this letter, let him be killed and buried, and all must be done before I come home. The boy set out with this letter, but he lost his way, and in the evening came to a large forest.  In the darkness he saw a small light, he went towards it and reached a cottage.  When he went in, an old woman was sitting by the fire quite alone.  She started when she saw the boy, and said, whence do you come, and whither are you going.  I come from the mill, he answered, and wish to go to the queen, to whom I am taking a letter, but as I have lost my way in the forest I should like to stay here over night. You poor boy, said the woman, you have come into a den of thieves, and when they come home they will kill you.  Let them come, said the boy, I am not afraid, but I am so tired that I cannot go any farther.  And he stretched himself upon a bench and fell asleep.  Soon afterwards the robbers came, and angrily asked what strange boy was lying there.  Ah, said the old woman, it is an innocent child who has lost himself in the forest, and out of pity I have let him come in, he has to take a letter to the queen.  The robbers opened the letter and read it, and in it was written that the boy as soon as he arrived should be put to death.  Then the hardhearted robbers felt pity, and their leader tore up the letter and wrote another, saying, that as soon as the boy came, he should be married at once to the king daughter.  Then they let him lie quietly on the bench until the next morning, and when he awoke they gave him the letter, and showed him the right way.  And the queen, when she had received the letter and read it, did as was written in it, and had a splendid wedding-feast prepared, and the king daughter was married to the child of good fortune, and as the youth was handsome and friendly she lived with him in joy and contentment.  After some time the king returned to his palace and saw that the prophecy was fulfilled, and the child married to his daughter. How has that come to pass, said he, I gave quite another order in my letter.  So the queen gave him the letter, and said that he might see for himself what was written in it.  The king read the letter and saw quite well that it had been exchanged for the other.  He asked the youth what had become of the letter entrusted to him, and why he had brought another instead of it.  I know nothing about it, answered he, it must have been changed in the night, when I slept in the forest.  The king said in a passion, you shall not have everything quite so much your own way, whosoever marries my daughter must fetch me from hell three golden hairs from the head of the devil, bring me what I want, and you shall keep my daughter.  In this way the king hoped to be rid of him for ever. But the child of good fortune answered, I will fetch the golden hairs, I am not afraid of the devil.  Whereupon he took leave of them and began his journey.  The road led him to a large town, where the watchman by the gates asked him what his trade was, and what he knew.  I know everything, answered the child of good fortune.  Then you can do us a favor, said the watchman, if you will tell us why our market fountain, which once flowed with wine has become dry, and no longer gives even water.  That you shall know, answered he, only wait until I come back.  Then he went farther and came to another town, and there also the gatekeeper asked him what was his trade, and what he knew. I know everything, answered he.  Then you can do us a favor and tell us why a tree in our town which once bore golden apples now does not even put forth leaves.  You shall know that, answered he, only wait until I come back.  Then he went on and came to a wide river over which he must cross. The ferryman asked him what his trade was, and what he knew.  I know everything, answered he.  Then you can do me a favor, said the ferryman, and tell me why I must always be rowing backwards and forwards, and am never set free.  You shall know that, answered he, only wait until I come back.  When he had crossed the water he found the entrance to hell.  It was black and sooty within, and the devil was not at home, but his grandmother was sitting in a large arm-chair.  What do you want, said she to him, but she did not look so very wicked.  I should like to have three golden hairs from the devil head, answered he, else I cannot keep my wife.  That is a good deal to ask for, said she, if the devil comes home and finds you, it will cost you your life, but as I pity you, I will see if I cannot help you.  She changed him into an ant and said, creep into the folds of my dress, you will be safe there.  Yes, answered he, so far, so good, but there are three things besides that I want to know - why a fountain which once flowed with wine has become dry, and no longer gives even water, why a tree which once bore golden apples does not even put forth leaves, and why a ferryman must always be going backwards and forwards, and is never set free. Those are difficult questions, answered she, but just be silent and quiet and pay attention to what the devil says when I pull out the three golden hairs.  As the evening came on, the devil returned home.  No sooner had he entered than he noticed that the air was not pure.  I smell man flesh, said he, all is not right here.  Then he pried into every corner, and searched, but could not find anything.  His grandmother scolded him.  It has just been swept, said she, and everything put in order, and now you are upsetting it again, you have always got man flesh in your nose.  Sit down and eat your supper.  When he had eaten and drunk he was tired, and laid his head in his grandmother lap, and told her she should louse him a little. It was not long before he was fast asleep, snoring and breathing heavily.  Then the old woman took hold of a golden hair, pulled it out, and laid it down beside her.  Oh, cried the devil, what are you doing.  I have had a bad dream, answered the grandmother, so I seized hold of your hair.  What did you dream then, said the devil.  I dreamt that a fountain in a market-place from which wine once flowed was dried up, and not even water would flow out of it - what is the cause of it.  Oh, ho, if they did but know it, answered the devil, there is a toad sitting under a stone in the well - if they killed it, the wine would flow again.  The grandmother loused him again until he went to sleep and snored so that the windows shook.  Then she pulled the second hair out.  Ha, what are you doing, cried the devil angrily.  Do not take it ill, said she, I did it in a dream.  What have you dreamt this time, asked he.  I dreamt that in a certain kingdom there stood an apple-tree which had once borne golden apples, but now would not even bear leaves.  What, think you, was the reason. Oh, if they did but know, answered the devil.  A mouse is gnawing at the root - if they killed it they would have golden apples again, but if it gnaws much longer the tree will wither altogether.  But I have had enough of your dreams, if you disturb me in my sleep again you will get a box on the ear.  The grandmother spoke gently to him and picked his lice once more until he fell asleep and snored.  Then she took hold of the third golden hair and pulled it out.  The devil jumped up, roared out, and would have treated her ill if she had not quieted him again and said, who can help bad dreams.  What was the dream, then, asked he, and was quite curious.  I dreamt of a ferryman who complained that he must always ferry from one side to the other, and was never released.  What is the cause of it.  Ah, the fool, answered the devil, when anyone comes and wants to go across he must put the oar in his hand, and the other man will have to ferry and he will be free.  As the grandmother had plucked out the three golden hairs, and the three questions were answered, she let the old devil alone, and he slept until daybreak.  When the devil had gone out again the old woman took the ant out of the folds of her dress, and gave the child of good fortune his human shape again.  There are the three golden hairs for you, said she.  What the devil said to your three questions, I suppose you heard.  Yes, answered he, I heard, and will take care to remember.  You have what you want, said she, and now you can go your way.  He thanked the old woman for helping him in his need, and left hell well content that everything had turned out so fortunately.  When he came to the ferryman he was expected to give the promised answer.  Ferry me across first, said the child of good fortune, and then I will tell you how you can be set free, and when he reached the opposite shore he gave him the devil advice. Next time anyone comes, who wants to be ferried over, just put the oar in his hand.  He went on and came to the town wherein stood the unfruitful tree, and there too the watchman wanted an answer.  So he told him what he had heard from the devil.  Kill the mouse which is gnawing at its root, and it will again bear golden apples.  Then the watchman thanked him, and gave him as a reward two asses laden with gold, which followed him.  Finally, he came to the town whose well was dry.  He told the watchman what the devil had said, a toad is in the well beneath a stone, you must find it and kill it, and the well will again give wine in plenty.  The watchman thanked him, and also gave him two asses laden with gold.  At last the child of good fortune got home to his wife, who was heartily glad to see him again, and to hear how well he had prospered in everything.  To the king he took what he had asked for, the devil three golden hairs, and when the king saw the four asses laden with gold he was quite content, and said, now all the conditions are fulfilled, and you can keep my daughter.  But tell me, dear son-in-law, where did all that gold come from - this is tremendous wealth.  I was rowed across a river, answered he, and got it there, it lies on the shore instead of sand.  Can I too fetch some of it, said the king, and he was quite eager about it.  As much as you like, answered he.  There is a ferryman on the river, let him ferry you over, and you can fill your sacks on the other side.  The greedy king set out in all haste, and when he came to the river he beckoned to the ferryman to put him across.  The ferryman came and bade him get in, and when they got to the other shore he put the oar in his hand and sprang over.  But from this time forth the king had to ferry, as a punishment for his sins.  Perhaps he is ferrying still.  If he is, it is because no one has taken the oar from him. In olden times when wishing still helped one, there lived a king whose daughters were all beautiful, but the youngest was so beautiful that the sun itself, which has seen so much, was astonished whenever it shone in her face.  Close by the king castle lay a great dark forest, and under an old lime-tree in the forest was a well, and when the day was very warm, the king child went out into the forest and sat down by the side of the cool fountain, and when she was bored she took a golden ball, and threw it up on high and caught it, and this ball was her favorite plaything.  Now it so happened that on one occasion the princess golden ball did not fall into the little hand which she was holding up for it, but on to the ground beyond, and rolled straight into the water.  The king daughter followed it with her eyes, but it vanished, and the well was deep, so deep that the bottom could not be seen.  At this she began to cry, and cried louder and louder, and could not be comforted.  And as she thus lamented someone said to her, "What ails you, king daughter?  You weep so that even a stone would show pity."  She looked round to the side from whence the voice came, and saw a frog stretching forth its big, ugly head from the water.  "Ah, old water-splasher, is it you," she said, "I am weeping for my golden ball, which has fallen into the well."  "Be quiet, and do not weep," answered the frog, "I can help you, but what will you give me if I bring your plaything up again?"  "Whatever you will have, dear frog," said she, "My clothes, my pearls and jewels, and even the golden crown which I am wearing."  The frog answered, "I do not care for your clothes, your pearls and jewels, nor for your golden crown, but if you will love me and let me be your companion and play-fellow, and sit by you at your little table, and eat off your little golden plate, and drink out of your little cup, and sleep in your little bed - if you will promise me this I will go down below, and bring you your golden ball up again."  "Oh yes," said she, "I promise you all you wish, if you will but bring me my ball back again."  But she thought, "How the silly frog does talk.  All he does is to sit in the water with the other frogs, and croak.  He can be no companion to any human being."  But the frog when he had received this promise, put his head into the water and sank down; and in a short while came swimmming up again with the ball in his mouth, and threw it on the grass.  The king daughter was delighted to see her pretty plaything once more, and picked it up, and ran away with it.  "Wait, wait," said the frog.  "Take me with you.  I can;t run as you can."  But what did it avail him to scream his croak, croak, after her, as loudly as he could.  She did not listen to it, but ran home and soon forgot the poor frog, who was forced to go back into his well again.  The next day when she had seated herself at table with the king and all the courtiers, and was eating from her little golden plate, something came creeping splish splash, splish splash, up the marble staircase, and when it had got to the top, it knocked at the door and cried, "Princess, youngest princess, open the door for me."  She ran to see who was outside, but when she opened the door, there sat the frog in front of it.  Then she slammed the door to, in great haste, sat down to dinner again, and was quite frightened.  The king saw plainly that her heart was beating violently, and said, "My child, what are you so afraid of?  Is there perchance a giant outside who wants to carry you away?"  "Ah, no," replied she.  "It is no giant but a disgusting frog."  "What does a frog want with you?"  "Ah, dear father, yesterday as I was in the forest sitting by the well, playing, my golden ball fell into the water.  And because I cried so, the frog brought it out again for me, and because he so insisted, I promised him he should be my companion, but I never thought he would be able to come out of his water.  And now he is outside there, and wants to come in to me."  In the meantime it knocked a second time, and cried,  "Princess, youngest princess,  open the door for me,  do you not know what you said to me yesterday by the cool waters of the well.  Princess, youngest princess,  open the door for me."  Then said the king, "That which you have promised must you perform. Go and let him in."  She went and opened the door, and the frog hopped in and followed her, step by step, to her chair. There he sat and cried, "Lift me up beside you."  She delayed, until at last the king commanded her to do it.  Once the frog was on the chair he wanted to be on the table, and when he was on the table he said, "Now, push your little golden plate nearer to me that we may eat together."  She did this, but it was easy to see that she did not do it willingly.  The frog enjoyed what he ate, but almost every mouthful she took choked her.  At length he said, "I have eaten and am satisfied, now I am tired, carry me into your little room and make your little silken bed ready, and we will both lie down and go to sleep."  The king daughter began to cry, for she was afraid of the cold frog which she did not like to touch, and which was now to sleep in her pretty, clean little bed.  But the king grew angry and said, "He who helped you when you were in trouble ought not afterwards to be despised by you."  So she took hold of the frog with two fingers, carried him upstairs, and put him in a corner, but when she was in bed he crept to her and said, "I am tired, I want to sleep as well as you, lift me up or I will tell your father."  At this she was terribly angry, and took him up and threw him with all her might against the wall.  "Now, will you be quiet, odious frog," said she.  But when he fell down he was no frog but a king son with kind and beautiful eyes.  He by her father will was now her dear companion and husband.  Then he told her how he had been bewitched by a wicked witch, and how no one could have delivered him from the well but herself, and that to-morrow they would go together into his kingdom.  Then they went to sleep, and next morning when the sun awoke them, a carriage came driving up with eight white horses, which had white ostrich feathers on their heads, and were harnessed with golden chains, and behind stood the young king servant Faithful Henry. Faithful Henry had been so unhappy when his master was changed into a frog, that he had caused three iron bands to be laid round his heart, lest it should burst with grief and sadness.  The carriage was to conduct the young king into his kingdom.  Faithful Henry helped them both in, and placed himself behind again, and was full of joy because of this deliverance.  And when they had driven a part of the way the king son heard a cracking behind him as if something had broken. So he turned round and cried, "Henry, the carriage is breaking." "No, master, it is not the carriage.  It is a band from my heart, which was put there in my great pain when you were a frog and imprisoned in the well."  Again and once again while they were on their way something cracked, and each time the king son thought the carriage was breaking, but it was only the bands which were springing from the heart of Faithful Henry because his master was set free and was happy. There was once upon a time an old goat who had seven little kids, and loved them with all the love of a mother for her children. One day she wanted to go into the forest and fetch some food. So she called all seven to her and said, dear children, I have to go into the forest, be on your guard against the wolf, if he comes in, he will devour you all - skin, hair, and everything.  The wretch often disguises himself, but you will know him at once by his rough voice and his black feet.  The kids said, dear mother, we will take good care of ourselves, you may go away without any anxiety.  Then the old one bleated, and went on her way with an easy mind.  It was not long before some one knocked at the house-door and called, open the door, dear children, your mother is here, and has brought something back with her for each of you.  But the little kids knew that it was the wolf, by the rough voice.  We will not open the door, cried they, you are not our mother.  She has a soft, pleasant voice, but your voice is rough, you are the wolf.  Then the wolf went away to a shopkeeper and bought himself a great lump of chalk, ate this and made his voice soft with it. The he came back, knocked at the door of the house, and called, open the door, dear children, your mother is here and has brought something back with her for each of you.  But the wolf had laid his black paws against the window, and the children saw them and cried, we will not open the door, our mother has not black feet like you, you are the wolf.  Then the wolf ran to a baker and said, I have hurt my feet, rub some dough over them for me.  And when the baker had rubbed his feet over, he ran to the miller and said, strew some white meal over my feet for me.  The miller thought to himself, the wolf wants to deceive someone, and refused, but the wolf said, if you will not do it, I will devour you. Then the miller was afraid, and made his paws white for him. Truly, this the way of mankind.  So now the wretch went for the third time to the house-door, knocked at it and said, open the door for me, children, your dear little mother has come home, and has brought every one of you something back from the forest with her.  The little kids cried, first show us your paws that we may know if you are our dear little mother.  Then he put his paws in through the window, and when the kids saw that they were white, they believed that all he said was true, and opened the door. But who should come in but the wolf they were terrified and wanted to hide themselves.  One sprang under the table, the second into the bed, the third into the stove, the fourth into the kitchen, the fifth into the cupboard, the sixth under the washing-bowl, and the seventh into the clock-case.  But the wolf found them all, and used no great ceremony, one after the other he swallowed them down his throat.  The youngest, who was in the clock-case, was the only one he did not find. When the wolf had satisfied his appetite he took himself off, laid himself down under a tree in the green meadow outside, and began to sleep.  Soon afterwards the old goat came home again from the forest.  Ah.  What a sight she saw there.  The house-door stood wide open.  The table, chairs, and benches were thrown down, the washing-bowl lay broken to pieces, and the quilts and pillows were pulled off the bed.  She sought her children, but they were nowhere to be found.  She called them one after another by name, but no one answered.  At last, when she caame to the youngest, a soft voice cried, dear mother, I am in the clock-case.  She took the kid out, and it told her that the wolf had come and had eaten all the others. Then you may imagine how she wept over her poor children.  At length in her grief she went out, and the youngest kid ran with her.  When they came to the meadow, there lay the wolf by the tree and snored so loud that the branches shook.  She looked at him on every side and saw that something was moving and struggling in his gorged belly.  Ah, heavens, she said, is it possible that my poor children whom he has swallowed down for his supper, can be still alive.  Then the kid had to run home and fetch scissors, and a needle and thread and the goat cut open the monster stomach, and hardly had she make one cut, than one little kid thrust its head out, and when she cut farther, all six sprang out one after another, and were all still alive, and had suffered no injury whatever, for in his greediness the monster had swallowed them down whole.  What rejoicing there was.  They embraced their dear mother, and jumped like a sailor at his wedding.  The mother, however, said, now go and look for some big stones, and we will fill the wicked beast stomach with them while he is still asleep.  Then the seven kids dragged the stones thither with all speed, and put as many of them into his stomach as they could get in, and the mother sewed him up again in the greatest haste, so that he was not aware of anything and never once stirred.  When the wolf at length had had his fill of sleep, he got on his legs, and as the stones in his stomach made him very thirsty, he wanted to go to a well to drink.  But when he began to walk and move about, the stones in his stomach knocked against each other and rattled.  Then cried he,  what rumbles and tumbles against my poor bones.  I thought ;twas six kids,  but it feels like big stones. And when he got to the well and stooped over the water to drink, the heavy stones made him fall in, and he had to drown miserably.  When the seven kids saw that, they came running to the spot and cried aloud, the wolf is dead.  The wolf is dead, and danced for joy round about the well with their mother. There was once a poor peasant who sat in the evening by the hearth and poked the fire, and his wife sat and spun.  Then said he, how sad it is that we have no children.  With us all is so quiet, and in other houses it is noisy and lively. Yes, replied the wife, and sighed, even if we had only one, and it were quite small, and only as big as a thumb, I should be quite satisfied, and we would still love it with all our hearts. Now it so happened that the woman fell ill, and after seven months gave birth to a child, that was perfect in all its limbs, but no longer than a thumb.  Then said they, it is as we wished it to be, and it shall be our dear child.  And because of its size, they called it thumbling.  Though they did not let it want for food, the child did not grow taller, but remained as it had been at the first.  Nevertheless it looked sensibly out of its eyes, and soon showed itself to be a wise and nimble creature, for everything it did turned out well.  One day the peasant was getting ready to go into the forest to cut wood, when he said as if to himself, how I wish that there was someone who would bring the cart to me.  Oh father, cried thumbling, I will soon bring the cart, rely on that.  It shall be in the forest at the appointed time.  The man smiled and said, how can that be done, you are far too small to lead the horse by the reins.  That of no consequence, father, if my mother will only harness it, I shall sit in the horse ear and call out to him how he is to go.  Well, answered the man, for once we will try it.  When the time came, the mother harnessed the horse, and placed thumbling in its ear, and then the little creature cried, gee up, gee up.  Then it went quite properly as if with its master, and the cart went the right way into the forest.  It so happened that just as he was turning a corner, and the little one was crying, gee up, two strange men came towards him.  My word, said one of them, what is this.  There is a cart coming, and a driver is calling to the horse and still he is not to be seen.  That can;t be right, said the other, we will follow the cart and see where it stops.  The cart, however, drove right into the forest, and exactly to the place where the wood had been cut.  When thumbling saw his father, he cried to him, do you see, father, here I am with the cart, now take me down.  The father got hold of the horse with his left hand and with the right took his little son out of the ear.  Thumbling sat down quite merrily on a straw, but when the two strange men saw him, they did not know what to say for astonishment.  Then one of them took the other aside and said, listen, the little fellow would make our fortune if we exhibited him in a large town, for money.  We will buy him.  They went to the peasant and said, sell us the little man.  He shall be well treated with us.  No, replied the father, he is the apple of my eye, and all the money in the world cannot buy him from me.  Thumbling, however, when he heard of the bargain, had crept up the folds of his father coat, placed himself on his shoulder, and whispered in his ear, father do give me away, I will soon come back again.  Then the father parted with him to the two men for a handsome sum of money.  Where will you sit, they said to him.  Oh just set me on the rim of your hat, and then I can walk backwards and forwards and look at the country, and still not fall down.  They did as he wished, and when thumbling had taken leave of his father, they went away with him.  They walked until it was dusk, and then the little fellow said, do take me down, it is necessary.  Just stay up there, said the man on whose hat he sat, it makes no difference to me.  The birds sometimes let things fall on me.  No, said thumbling, I know what manners, take me quickly down.  The man took his hat off, and put the little fellow on the ground by the wayside, and he leapt and crept about a little between the sods, and then he suddenly slipped into a mousehole which he had sought out. Good evening, gentlemen, just go home without me, he cried to them, and mocked them.  They ran thither and stuck their sticks into the mousehole, but it was all in vain.  Thumbling crept still farther in, and as it soon became quite dark, they were forced to go home with their vexation and their empty purses.  When thumbling saw that they were gone, he crept back out of the subterranean passage.  It is so dangerous to walk on the ground in the dark, said he, how easily a neck or a leg is broken. Fortunately he stumbled against an empty snail-shell.  Thank God, said he, in that I can pass the night in safety.  And got into it. Not long afterwards, when he was just going to sleep, he heard two men go by, and one of them was saying, how shall we set about getting hold of the rich pastor silver and gold.  I could tell you that, cried thumbling, interrupting them.  What was that, said one of the thieves in fright, I heard someone speaking.  They stood still listening, and thumbling spoke again, and said, take me with you, and I;ll help you.  But where are you.  Just look on the ground, and observe from whence my voice comes, he replied.  There the thieves at length found him, and lifted him up.  You little imp, how will you help us, they said.  Listen, said he, I will creep into the pastor room through the iron bars, and will reach out to you whatever you want to have.  Come then, they said, and we will see what you can do.  When they got to the pastor house, thumbling crept into the room, but instantly cried out with all his might, do you want to have everything that is here.  The thieves were alarmed, and said, but do speak softly, so as not to waken any one.  Thumbling however, behaved as if he had not understood this, and cried again, what do you want.  Do you want to have everything that is here.  The cook, who slept in the next room, heard this and sat up in bed, and listened.  The thieves, however, had in their fright run some distance away, but at last they took courage, and thought, the little rascal wants to mock us.  They came back and whispered to him, come be serious, and reach something out to us. Then thumbling again cried as loudly as he could, I really will give you everything, just put your hands in.  The maid who was listening, heard this quite distinctly, and jumped out of bed and rushed to the door.  The thieves took flight, and ran as if the wild huntsman were behind them, but as the maid could not see anything, she went to strike a light.  When she came to the place with it, thumbling, unperceived, betook himself to the granary, and the maid after she had examined every corner and found nothing, lay down in her bed again, and believed that, after all, she had only been dreaming with open eyes and ears. Thumbling had climbed up among the hay and found a beautiful place to sleep in.  There he intended to rest until day, and then go home again to his parents.  But there were other things in store for him.  Truly, there is much worry and affliction in this world.  When the day dawned, the maid arose from her bed to feed the cows.  Her first walk was into the barn, where she laid hold of an armful of hay, and precisely that very one in which poor thumbling was lying asleep.  He, however, was sleeping so soundly that he was aware of nothing, and did not awake until he was in the mouth of the cow, who had picked him up with the hay.  Ah, heavens, cried he, how have I got into the fulling mill.  But he soon discovered where he was. Then he had to take care not to let himself go between the teeth and be dismembered, but he was subsequently forced to slip down into the stomach with the hay. In this little room the windows are forgotten, said he, and no sun shines in, neither will a candle be brought.  His quarters were especially unpleasing to him, and the worst was that more and more hay was always coming in by the door, and the space grew less and less.  When at length in his anguish, he cried as loud as he could, bring me no more fodder, bring me no more fodder.  The maid was just milking the cow, and when she heard some one speaking, and saw no one, and perceived that it was the same voice that she had heard in the night, she was so terrified that she slipped off her stool, and spilt the milk.  She ran in great haste to her master, and said, oh heavens, pastor, the cow has been speaking.  You are mad, replied the pastor, but he went himself to the byre to see what was there. Hardly, however had he set his foot inside when thumbling again cried, bring me no more fodder, bring me no more fodder.  Then the pastor himself was alarmed, and thought that an evil spirit had gone into the cow, and ordered her to be killed.  She was killed, but the stomach, in which thumbling was, was thrown on the dunghill.  Thumbling had great difficulty in working his way out.  However, he succeeded so far as to get some room, but just as he was going to thrust his head out, a new misfortune occurred.  A hungry wolf ran thither, and swallowed the whole stomach at one gulp.  Thumbling did not lose courage.  Perhaps, thought he, the wolf will listen to what I have got to say.  And he called to him from out of his belly, dear wolf, I know of a magnificent feast for you.  Where is it to be had, said the wolf. In such and such a house.  You must creep into it through the kitchen-sink, and will find cakes, and bacon, and sausages, and as much of them as you can eat.  And he described to him exactly his father house.  The wolf did not require to be told this twice, squeezed himself in at night through the sink, and ate to his heart content in the larder.  When he had eaten his fill, he wanted to go out again, but he had become so big that he could not go out by the same way.  Thumbling had reckoned on this, and now began to make a violent noise in the wolf body, and raged and screamed as loudly as he could.  Will you be quiet, said the wolf, you will waken up the people.  What do I care, replied the little fellow, you have eaten your fill, and I will make merry likewise.  And began once more to scream with all his strength.  At last his father and mother were aroused by it, and ran to the room and looked in through the opening in the door.  When they saw that a wolf was inside, they ran away, and teh husband fetched his axe, and the wife the scythe.  Stay behind, said the man, when they entered the room.  When I have given the blow, if he is not killed by it, you must cut him down and hew his body to pieces.  Then thumbling heard his parents, voices and cried, dear father, I am here, I am in the wolf body.  Said the father, full of joy, thank God, our dear child has found us again. And bade the woman take away her scythe, that thumbling might not be hurt with it.  After that he raised his arm, and struck the wolf such a blow on his head that he fell down dead, and then they got knives and scissors and cut his body open and drew the little fellow forth.  Ah, said the father, what sorrow we have gone through for your sake.  Yes father, I have gone about the world a great deal. Thank heaven, I breathe fresh air again.  Where have you been, then.  Ah, father, I have been in a mouse hole, in a cow belly, and then in a wolf paunch.  Now I will stay with you. And we will not sell you again, no not for all the riches in the world, said his parents, and they embraced and kissed their dear thumbling.  They gave him to eat and to drink, and had some new clothes made for him, for his own had been spoiled on his journey. One summer morning a little tailor was sitting on his table by the window, he was in good spirits, and sewed with all his might.  Then came a peasant woman down the street crying, good jams, cheap.  Good jams, cheap.  This rang pleasantly in the tailor ears, he stretched his delicate head out of the window, and called, come up here, dear woman, here you will get rid of your goods.  The woman came up the three steps to the tailor with her heavy basket, and he made her unpack all the pots for him.  He inspected each one, lifted it up, put his nose to it, and at length said, the jam seems to me to be good, so weigh me out four ounces, dear woman, and if it is a quarter of a pound that is of no consequence.  The woman who had hoped to find a good sale, gave him what he desired, but went away quite angry and grumbling.  Now, this jam shall be blessed by God, cried the little tailor, and give me health and strength.  So he brought the bread out of the cupboard, cut himself a piece right across the loaf and spread the jam over it.  This won;t taste bitter, said he, but I will just finish the jacket before I take a bite. He laid the bread near him, sewed on, and in his joy, made bigger and bigger stitches.  In the meantime the smell of the sweet jam rose to where the flies were sitting in great numbers, and they were attracted and descended on it in hosts.  HI, who invited you, said the little tailor, and drove the unbidden guests away.  The flies, however, who understood no german, would not be turned away, but came back again in ever-increasing companies.  The little tailor at last lost all patience, and drew a piece of cloth from the hole under his work-table, and saying, wait, and I will give it to you, struck it mercilessly on them.  When he drew it away and counted, there lay before him no fewer than seven, dead and with legs stretched out.  Are you a fellow of that sort, said he, and could not help admiring his own bravery.  The whole town shall know of this.  And the little tailor hastened to cut himself a girdle, stitched it, and embroidered on it in large letters, seven at one stroke.  What, the town, he continued, the whole world shall hear of it.  And his heart wagged with joy like a lamb tail.  The tailor put on the girdle, and resolved to go forth into the world, because he thought his workshop was too small for his valor.  Before he went away, he sought about in the house to see if there was anything which he could take with him, however, he found nothing but an old cheese, and that he put in his pocket.  In front of the door he observed a bird which had caught itself in the thicket.  It had to go into his pocket with the cheese.  Now he took to the road boldly, and as he was light and nimble, he felt no fatigue.  The road led him up a mountain, and when he had reached the highest point of it, there sat a powerful giant looking peacefully about him.  The little tailor went bravely up, spoke to him, and said, good day, comrade, so you are sitting there overlooking the wide-spread world.  I am just on my way thither, and want to try my luck.  Have you any inclination to go with me.  The giant looked contemptuously at the tailor, and said, you ragamuffin.  You miserable creature. Oh, indeed, answered the little tailor, and unbuttoned his coat, and showed the giant the girdle, there may you read what kind of a man I am.  The giant read, seven at one stroke.  And thought that they had been men whom the tailor had killed, and began to feel a little respect for the tiny fellow.  Nevertheless, he wished to try him first, and took a stone in his hand and squeezed it together so that water dropped out of it.  Do that likewise, said the giant, if you have strength.  Is that all, said the tailor, that is child play with us, and put his hand into his pocket, brought out the soft cheese, and pressed it until the liquid ran out of it.  Faith, said he, that was a little better, wasn;t it.  The giant did not know what to say, and could not believe it of the little man.  Then the giant picked up a stone and threw it so high that the eye could scarcely follow it.  Now, little mite of a man, do that likewise.  Well thrown, said the tailor, but after all the stone came down to earth again, I will throw you one which shall never come back at all.  And he put his hand into his pocket, took out the bird, and threw it into the air.  The bird, delighted with its liberty, rose, flew away and did not come back.  How does that shot please you, comrade, asked the tailor. You can certainly throw, said the giant, but now we will see if you are able to carry anything properly.  He took the little tailor to a mighty oak tree which lay there felled on the ground, and said, if you are strong enough, help me to carry the tree out of the forest.  Readily, answered the little man, take the trunk on your shoulders, and I will raise up the branches and twigs, after all, they are the heaviest.  The giant took the trunk on his shoulder, but the tailor seated himself on a branch, and the giant who could not look round, had to carry away the whole tree, and the little tailor into the bargain, he behind, was quite merry and happy, and whistled the song, three tailors rode forth from the gate, as if carrying the tree were child play.  The giant, after he had dragged the heavy burden part of the way, could go no further, and cried, hark you, I shall have to let the tree fall.  The tailor sprang nimbly down, seized the tree with both arms as if he had been carrying it, and said to the giant, you are such a great fellow, and yet can not even carry the tree. They went on together, and as they passed a cherry-tree, the giant laid hold of the top of the tree where the ripest fruit was hanging, bent it down, gave it into the tailor hand, and bade him eat.  But the little tailor was much too weak to hold the tree, and when the giant let it go, it sprang back again, and the tailor was tossed into the air with it.  When he had fallen down again without injury, the giant said, what is this.  Have you not strength enough to hold the weak twig.  There is no lack of strength, answered the little tailor.  Do you think that could be anything to a man who has struck down seven at one blow.  I leapt over the tree because the huntsmen are shooting down there in the thicket.  Jump as I did, if you can do it.  The giant made the attempt, but could not get over the tree, and remained hanging in the branches, so that in this also the tailor kept the upper hand. The giant said, if you are such a valiant fellow, come with me into our cavern and spend the night with us.  The little tailor was willing, and followed him.  When they went into the cave, other giants were sitting there by the fire, and each of them had a roasted sheep in his hand and was eating it.  The little tailor looked round and thought, it is much more spacious here than in my workshop.  The giant showed him a bed, and said he was to lie down in it and sleep.  The bed, however, was too big for the little tailor, he did not lie down in it, but crept into a corner.  When it was midnight, and the giant thought that the little tailor was lying in a sound sleep, he got up, took a great iron bar, cut through the bed with one blow, and thought he had finished off the grasshopper for good.  With the earliest dawn the giants went into the forest, and had quite forgotten the little tailor, when all at once he walked up to them quite merrily and boldly.  The giants were terrified, they were afraid that he would strike them all dead, and ran away in a great hurry. The little tailor went onwards, always following his own pointed nose.  After he had walked for a long time, he came to the courtyard of a royal palace, and as he felt weary, he lay down on the grass and fell asleep.  Whilst he lay there, the people came and inspected him on all sides, and read on his girdle, seven at one stroke.  Ah, said they, what does the great warrior here in the midst of peace.  He must be a mighty lord.  They went and announced him to the king, and gave it as their opinion that if war should break out, this would be a weighty and useful man who ought on no account to be allowed to depart.  The counsel pleased the king, and he sent one of his courtiers to the little tailor to offer him military service when he awoke.  The ambassador remained standing by the sleeper, waited until he stretched his limbs and opened his eyes, and then conveyed to him this proposal.  For this reason have I come here, the tailor replied, I am ready to enter the king service.  He was therefore honorably received and a special dwelling was assigned him. The soldiers, however, were set against the little tailor, and wished him a thousand miles away.  What is to be the end of this, they said among themselves.  If we quarrel with him, and he strikes about him, seven of us will fall at every blow, not one of us can stand against him.  They came therefore to a decision, betook themselves in a body to the king, and begged for their dismissal.  We are not prepared, said they, to stay with a man who kills seven at one stroke.  The king was sorry that for the sake of one he should lose all his faithful servants, wished that he had never set eyes on the tailor, and would willingly have been rid of him again.  But he did not venture to give him his dismissal, for he dreaded lest he should strike him and all his people dead, and place himself on the royal throne.  He thought about it for a long time, and at last found good counsel.  He sent to the little tailor and caused him to be informed that as he was such a great warrior, he had one request to make of him. In a forest of his country lived two giants who caused great mischief with their robbing, murdering, ravaging, and burning, and no one could approach them without putting himself in danger of death.  If the tailor conquered and killed these two giants, he would give him his only daughter to wife, and half of his kingdom as a dowry, likewise one hundred horsemen should go with him to assist him.  That would indeed be a fine thing for a man like me, thought the little tailor.  One is not offered a beautiful princess and half a kingdom every day of one life. Oh, yes, he replied, I will soon subdue the giants, and do not require the help of the hundred horsemen to do it, he who can hit seven with one blow has no need to be afraid of two. The little tailor went forth, and the hundred horsemen followed him.  When he came to the outskirts of the forest, he said to his followers, just stay waiting here, I alone will soon finish off the giants.  Then he bounded into the forest and looked about right and left.  After a while he perceived both giants.  They lay sleeping under a tree, and snored so that the branches waved up and down.  The little tailor, not idle, gathered two pocketsful of stones, and with these climbed up the tree.  When he was half-way up, he slipped down by a branch, until he sat just above the sleepers, and then let one stone after another fall on the breast of one of the giants.  For a long time the giant felt nothing, but at last he awoke, pushed his comrade, and said, why are you knocking me.  You must be dreaming, said the other, I am not knocking you.  They laid themselves down to sleep again, and then the tailor threw a stone down on the second.  What is the meaning of this, cried the other.  Why are you pelting me.  I am not pelting you, answered the first, growling.  They disputed about it for a time, but as they were weary they let the matter rest, and their eyes closed once more.  The little tailor began his game again, picked out the biggest stone, and threw it with all his might on the breast of the first giant.  That is too bad, cried he, and sprang up like a madman, and pushed his companion against the tree until it shook.  The other paid him back in the same coin, and they got into such a rage that they tore up trees and belabored each other so long, that at last they both fell down dead on the ground at the same time.  Then the little tailor leapt down.  It is a lucky thing, said he, that they did not tear up the tree on which I was sitting, or I should have had to spring on to another like a squirrel, but we tailors are nimble.  He drew out his sword and gave each of them a couple of thrusts in the breast, and then went out to the horsemen and said, the work is done, I have finished both of them off, but it was hard work.  They tore up trees in their sore need, and defended themselves with them, but all that is to no purpose when a man like myself comes, who can kill seven at one blow. But you are not wounded, asked the horsemen.  You need not concern yourself about that, answered the tailor, they have not bent one hair of mine.  The horsemen would not believe him, and rode into the forest, there they found the giants swimming in their blood, and all round about lay the torn-up trees. The little tailor demanded of the king the promised reward.  He, however, repented of his promise, and again bethought himself how he could get rid of the hero.  Before you receive my daughter, and the half of my kingdom, said he to him, you must perform one more heroic deed.  In the forest roams a unicorn which does great harm, and you must catch it first.  I fear one unicorn still less than two giants.  Seven at one blow, is my kind of affair. He took a rope and an axe with him, went forth into the forest, and again bade those who were sent with him to wait outside.  He had not long to seek.  The unicorn soon came towards him, and rushed directly on the tailor, as if it would gore him with its horn without more ado.  Softly, softly, it can;t be done as quickly as that, said he, and stood still and waited until the animal was quite close, and then sprang nimbly behind the tree. The unicorn ran against the tree with all its strength, and struck its horn so fast in the trunk that it had not strength enough to draw it out again, and thus it was caught.  Now, I have got the bird, said the tailor, and came out from behind the tree and put the rope round its neck, and then with his axe he hewed the horn out of the tree, and when all was ready he led the beast away and took it to the king. The king still would not give him the promised reward, and made a third demand.  Before the wedding the tailor was to catch him a wild boar that made great havoc in the forest, and the huntsmen should give him their help.  Willingly, said the tailor, that is child play.  He did not take the huntsmen with him into the forest, and they were well pleased that he did not, for the wild boar had several times received them in such a manner that they had no inclination to lie in wait for him.  When the boar perceived the tailor, it ran on him with foaming mouth and whetted tusks, and was about to throw him to the ground, but the hero fled and sprang into a chapel which was near, and up to the window at once, and in one bound out again.  The boar ran in after him, but the tailor ran round outside and shut the door behind it, and then the raging beast, which was much too heavy and awkward to leap out of the window, was caught.  The little tailor called the huntsmen thither that they might see the prisoner with their own eyes.  The hero, however went to the king, who was now, whether he liked it or not, obliged to keep his promise, and gave him his daughter and the half of his kingdom.  Had he known that it was no warlike hero, but a little tailor who was standing before him it would have gone to his heart still more than it did.  The wedding was held with great magnificence and small joy, and out of a tailor a king was made. After some time the young queen heard her husband say in his dreams at night, boy, make me the doublet, and patch the pantaloons, or else I will rap the yard-measure over your ears. Then she discovered in what state of life the young lord had been born, and next morning complained of her wrongs to her father, and begged him to help her to get rid of her husband, who was nothing else but a tailor.  The king comforted her and said, leave your bedroom door open this night, and my servants shall stand outside, and when he has fallen asleep shall go in, bind him, and take him on board a ship which shall carry him into the wide world.  The woman was satisfied with this, but the king armor-bearer, who had heard all, was friendly with the young lord, and informed him of the whole plot.  I;ll put a screw into that business, said the little tailor.  At night he went to bed with his wife at the usual time, and when she thought that he had fallen asleep, she got up, opened the door, and then lay down again.  The little tailor, who was only pretending to be asleep, began to cry out in a clear voice, boy, make me the doublet and patch me the pantaloons, or I will rap the yard-measure over your ears.  I smote seven at one blow.  I killed two giants, I brought away one unicorn and caught a wild boar, and am I to fear those who are standing outside the room.  When these men heard the tailor speaking thus, they were overcome by a great dread, and ran as if the wild huntsman were behind them, and none of them would venture anything further against him.  So the little tailor was and remained a king to the end of his life. There was once upon a time a tailor who had three sons, and only one goat.  But as the goat supported all of them with her milk, she was obliged to have good food, and to be taken every day to pasture.  The sons did this, in turn.  Once the eldest took her to the churchyard, where the finest herbs were to be found, and let her eat and run about there.  At night when it was time to go home he asked, goat, have you had enough.  The goat answered      I have eaten so much,      not a leaf more I;ll touch, meh. Meh.  Come home, then, said the youth, and took hold of the cord round her neck, led her into the stable and tied her up securely. Well, said the old tailor, has the goat had as much food as she ought.  Oh, answered the son, she has eaten so much, not a leaf more she;ll touch.  But the father wished to satisfy himself, and went down to the stable, stroked the dear animal and asked, goat, are you satisfied.  The goat answered,      how should I be satisfied.      Among the ditches I leapt about,      found no leaf, so went without, meh. Meh.  What do I hear, cried the tailor, and ran upstairs and said to the youth.  HI, you liar, you said the goat had had enough, and have let her hunger, and in his anger he took the yard-measure from the wall, and drove him out with blows.  Next day it was the turn of the second son, who sought a place in the fence of the garden, where nothing but good herbs grew, and the goat gobbled them all up.  At night when he wanted to go home, he asked, goat, are you satisfied.  The goat answered,      I have eaten so much,      not a leaf more I;ll touch, meh. Meh.  Come home, then, said the youth, and led her home, and tied her up in the stable.  Well, said the old tailor, has the goat had as much food as she ought.  Oh, answered the son, she has eaten so much, not a leaf more she;ll touch.  The tailor would not rely on this, but went down to the stable and said, goat, have you had enough.  The goat answered,      how should I be satisfied.      Among the ditches I leapt about,      found no leaf, so went without, meh. Meh.  The godless wretch. Cried the tailor, to let such a good animal hunger, and he ran up and drove the youth out of doors with the yard-measure.  Now came the turn of the third son, who wanted to do his duty well, and sought out some bushes with the finest leaves, and let the goat devour them.  In the evening when he wanted to go home, he asked, goat, have you had enough.  The goat answered,      I have eaten so much,      not a leaf more I;ll touch, meh. Meh.  Come home, then, said the youth, and led her into the stable, and tied her up.  Well, said the old tailor, has the goat had her full share of food.  She has eaten so much, not a leaf more she;ll touch.  The tailor was distrustful, went down and asked, goat, have you had enough.  The wicked beast answered,      how should I be satisfied.      Among the ditches I leapt about,      found no leaf, so went without, meh. Meh.  Oh, the brood of liars, cried the tailor, each as wicked and forgetful of his duty as the other.  You shall no longer make a fool of me, and quite beside himself with anger, he ran upstairs and belabored the poor young fellow so vigorously with the yard-measure that he sprang out of the house.  The old tailor was now alone with his goat.  Next morning he went down into the stable, stroked the goat and said, come, my dear little animal, I myself will take you to feed.  He took her by the rope and conducted her to green hedges, and amongst milfoil and whatever else goats like to eat.  There you may for once eat to your heart content, said he to her, and let her browse till evening.  Then he asked, goat, are you satisfied.  She replied.      I have eaten so much,      not a leaf more I;ll touch, meh. Meh.  Come home, then, said the tailor, and led her into the stable, and tied her fast.  When he was going away, he turned round again and said, well, are you satisfied for once.  But the goat behaved no better to him, and cried,      how should I be satisfied.      Among the ditches I leapt about,      found no leaf, so went without, meh. Meh.  When the tailor heard that, he was shocked, and saw clearly that he had driven away his three sons without cause.  Wait, you ungrateful creature, cried he, it is not enough to drive you forth, I will brand you so that you will no more dare to show yourself amongst honest tailors.  In great haste he ran upstairs, fetched his razor, lathered the goat head, and shaved her as clean as the palm of his hand.  And as the yard-measure would have been too good for her, he brought the horsewhip, and gave her such cuts with it that she bounded away with tremendous leaps.  When the tailor was thus left quite alone in his house he fell into great grief, and would gladly have had his sons back again, but no one knew whither they were gone.  The eldest had apprenticed himself to a joiner, and learnt industriously and indefatigably, and when the time came for him to go traveling, his master presented him with a little table which was not particularly beautiful, and was made of common wood, but which had one good property.  If anyone set it out, and said, little table, spread yourself, the good little table was at once covered with a clean little cloth, and a plate was there, and a knife and fork beside it, and dishes with boiled meats and roasted meats, as many as there was room for, and a great glass of red wine shone so that it made the heart glad.  The young journeyman thought, with this you have enough for your whole life, and went joyously about the world and never troubled himself at all whether an inn was good or bad, or if anything was to be found in it or not.  When it suited him he did not enter an inn at all, but either on the plain, in a wood, a meadow, or wherever he fancied, he took his little table off his back, set it down before him, and said, spread yourself, and then everything appeared that his heart desired.  At length he took it into his head to go back to his father, whose anger would now be appeased, and who would now willingly receive him with his magic table.  It came to pass that on his way home, he came one evening to an inn which was filled with guests.  They bade him welcome, and invited him to sit and eat with them, for otherwise he would have difficulty in getting anything.  No, answered the joiner, I will not take the few morsels out of your mouths.  Rather than that, you shall be my guests.  They laughed, and thought he was jesting with them.  He but placed his wooden table in the middle of the room, and said, little table, spread yourself.  Instantly it was covered with food, so good that the host could never have procured it, and the smell of it ascended pleasantly to the nostrils of the guests.  Fall to, dear friends, said the joiner, and the guests when they saw that he meant it, did not need to be asked twice, but drew near, pulled out their knives and attacked it valiantly.  And what surprised them the most was that when a dish became empty, a full one instantly took its place of its own accord.  The innkeeper stood in one corner and watched the affair.  He did not at all know what to say, but thought, you could easily find a use for such a cook as that in your household.  The joiner and his comrades made merry until late into the night.  At length they lay down to sleep, and the young apprentice also went to bed, and set his magic table against the wall.  The host thoughts, however, let him have no rest.  It occurred to him that there was a little old table in his lumber-room which looked just like the apprentice and he brought it out, and carefully exchanged it for the wishing table.  Next morning the joiner paid for his bed, took up his table, never thinking that he had got a false one, and went his way.  At mid-day he reached his father, who received him with great joy.  Well, my dear son, what have you learnt.  Said he to him.  Father, I have become a joiner.  A good trade, replied the old man, but what have you brought back with you from your apprenticeship.  Father, the best thing which I have brought back with me is this little table.  The tailor inspected it on all sides and said, you did not make a masterpiece when you made that.  It is a bad old table.  But it is a table which furnishes itself, replied the son.  When I set it out, and tell it to spread itself, the most beautiful dishes stand on it, and a wine also, which gladdens the heart.  Just invite all our relations and friends, they shall refresh and enjoy themselves for once, for the table will give them all they require.  When the company was assembled, he put his table in the middle of the room and said, little table, spread yourself, but the little table did not bestir itself, and remained just as bare as any other table which does not understand language.  Then the poor apprentice became aware that his table had been changed, and was ashamed at having to stand there like a liar.  The relations, however, mocked him, and were forced to go home without having eaten or drunk.  The father brought out his patches again, and went on tailoring, but the son went to a master in the craft.  The second son had gone to a miller and had apprenticed himself to him.  When his years were over, the master said, as you have conducted yourself so well, I give you an ass of a peculiar kind, which neither draws a cart nor carries a sack.  What good is he, then. Asked the young apprentice.  He spews forth gold, answered the miller.  If you set him on a cloth and say bricklebrit, the good animal will spew forth gold pieces for you from back and front.  That is a fine thing, said the apprentice, and thanked the master, and went out into the world.  When he had need of gold, he had only to say bricklebrit to his ass, and it rained gold pieces, and he had nothing to do but pick them off the ground. Wheresoever he went, the best of everything was good enough for him, and the dearer the better, for he had always a full purse. When he had looked about the world for some time, he thought, you must seek out your father.  If you go to him with the gold-ass he will forget his anger, and receive you well.  It came to pass that he came to the same inn in which his brother table had been exchanged.  He led his ass by the bridle, and the host was about to take the animal from him and tie him up, but the young apprentice said, don;t trouble yourself, I will take my grey horse into the stable, and tie him up myself too, for I must know where he stands.  This struck the host as odd, and he thought that a man who was forced to look after his ass himself, could not have much to spend.  But when the stranger put his hand in his pocket and brought out two gold pieces, and said he was to provide something good for him, the host opened his eyes wide, and ran and sought out the best he could muster.  After dinner the guest asked what he owed.  The host did not see why he should not double the reckoning, and said the apprentice must give two more gold pieces.  He felt in his pocket, but his gold was just at an end.  Wait an instant, sir host, said he, I will go and fetch some money.  But he took the table-cloth with him.  The host could not imagine what this could mean, and being curious, stole after him, and as the guest bolted the stable door, he peeped through a hole left by a knot in the wood.  The stranger spread out the cloth under the animal and cried, bricklebrit, and immediately the beast began to let gold pieces fall from back and front, so that it fairly rained down money on the ground.  Eh, my word, said the host, ducats are quickly coined there.  A purse like that is not to be sniffed at.  The guest paid his score, and went to bed, but in the night the host stole down into the stable, led away the master of the mint, and tied up another ass in his place.  Early next morning the apprentice traveled away with his ass, and thought that he had his gold-ass.  At mid-day he reached his father, who rejoiced to see him again, and gladly took him in. What have you made of yourself, my son.  Asked the old man. A miller, dear father, he answered.  What have you brought back with you from your travels.  Nothing else but an ass.  There are asses enough here, said the father, I would rather have had a good goat.  Yes, replied the son, but it is no common ass, but a gold-ass, when I say bricklebrit, the good beast spews forth a whole sheetful of gold pieces.  Just summon all our relations hither, and I will make them rich folks.  That suits me well, said the tailor, for then I shall have no need to torment myself any longer with the needle, and ran out himself and called the relations together.  As soon as they were assembled, the miller bade them make way, spread out his cloth, and brought the ass into the room. Now watch, said he, and cried, bricklebrit, but what fell were not gold pieces, and it was clear that the animal knew nothing of the art, for every ass does not attain such perfection.  Then the poor miller pulled a long face, saw that he was betrayed, and begged pardon of the relatives, who went home as poor as they came.  There was no help for it, the old man had to betake him to his needle once more, and the youth hired himself to a miller.  The third brother had apprenticed himself to a turner, and as that is skilled labor, he was the longest in learning.  His brothers, however, told him in a letter how badly things had gone with them, and how the innkeeper had cheated them of ther beautiful wishing-gifts on the last evening before they reached home.  When the turner had served his time, and had to set out on his travels, as he had conducted himself so well, his master presented him with a sack and said, there is a cudgel in it.  I can put on the sack, said he, and it may be of good service to me, but why should the cudgel be in it.  It only makes it heavy.  I will tell you why, replied the master.  If anyone has done anything to injure you, do but say, out of the sack, cudgel. And the cudgel will leap forth among the people, and play such a dance on their backs that they will not be able to stir or move for a week, and it will not leave off until you say, into the sack, cudgel.  The apprentice thanked him, and put the sack on his back, and when anyone came too near him, and wished to attack him, he said, out of the sack, cudgel, and instantly the cudgel sprang out, and dusted the coat or jacket of one after the other on their backs, and never stopped until it had stripped it off them, and it was done so quickly, that before anyone was aware, it was already his own turn.  In the evening the young turner reached the inn where his brothers had been cheated.  He laid his sack on the table before him, and began to talk of all the wonderful things which he had seen in the world.  Yes, said he, people may easily find a table which will spread itself, a gold-ass, and things of that kind - extremely good things which I by no means despise - but these are nothing in comparison with the treasure which I have won for myself, and am carrying about with me in my sack there.  The innkeeper pricked up his ears. What in the world can that be.  Thought he.  The sack must be filled with nothing but jewels.  I ought to get them cheap too, for all good things go in threes.  When it was time for sleep, the guest stretched himself on the bench, and laid his sack beneath him for a pillow.  When the innkeeper thought his guest was lying in a sound sleep, he went to him and pushed and pulled quite gently and carefully at the sack to see if he could possibly draw it away and lay another in its place.  The turner, however, had been waiting for this for a long time, and now just as the inn-keeper was about to give a hearty tug, he cried, out of the sack, cudgel.  Instantly the little cudgel came forth, and fell on the inn-keeper and gave him a sound thrashing. The host cried for mercy.  But the louder he cried, the harder the cudgel beat the time on his back, until at length he fell to the ground exhausted.  Then the turner said, if you do not give back the table which spreads itself, and the gold-ass, the dance shall begin afresh.  Oh, no, cried the host, quite humbly, I will gladly produce everything, only make the accursed kobold creep back into the sack.  Then said the apprentice, I will let mercy take the place of justice, but beware of getting into mischief again.  So he cried, into the sack, cudgel.  And let him have rest.  Next morning the turner went home to his father with the wishing-table, and the gold-ass.  The tailor rejoiced when he saw him once more, and asked him likewise what he had learned in foreign parts.  Dear father, said he, I have become a turner.  A skilled trade, said the father.  What have you brought back with you from your travels.  A precious thing, dear father, replied the son, a cudgel in the sack.  What cried the father, a cudgel.  That certainly worth your trouble.  From every tree you can cut yourself one.  But not one like this, dear father.  If I say, out of the sack, cudgel, the cudgel springs out and leads anyone ill-disposed toward me a weary dance, and never stops until he lies on the ground and prays for fair weather.  Look you, with this cudgel have I rescued the wishing-table and the gold-ass which the thievish innkeeper took away from my brothers.  Now let them both be sent for, and invite all our kinsmen.  I will give them to eat and to drink, and will fill their pockets with gold into the bargain.  The old tailor had not much confidence.  Nevertheless he summoned the relatives together.  Then the turner spread a cloth in the room and led in the gold-ass, and said to his brother, now, dear brother, speak to him. The miller said, bricklebrit, and instantly the gold pices rained down on the cloth like a thunder-shower, and the ass did not stop until every one of them had so much that he could carry no more.  - I can see by your face that you also would have liked to be there. -  Then the turner brought the little table, and said, now dear brother, speak to it.  And scarcely had the carpenter said, table, spread yourself, than it was spread and amply covered with the most exquisite dishes.  Then such a meal took place as the good tailor had never yet known in his house, and the whole party of kinsmen stayed together till far in the night, and were all merry and glad.  The tailor locked away needle and thread, yard-measure and goose, in a closet, and lived with his three sons in joy and splendor.  What, however, happened to the goat who was to blame for the tailor driving out his three sons?  That I will tell you.  She was ashamed that she had a bald head, and ran to a fox hole and crept into it.  When the fox came home, he was met by two great eyes shining out of the darkness, and was terrified and ran away. A bear met him, and as the fox looked quite disturbed, he said, what is the matter with you, brother fox, why do you look like that.  Ah, answered redskin, a fierce beast is in my cave and stared at me with its fiery eyes.  We will soon drive him out, said the bear, and went with him to the cave and looked in, but when he saw the fiery eyes, fear seized on him likewise.  He would have nothing to do with the furious beast, and took to his heels.  The bee met him, and as she saw that he was ill at ease, she said, bear, you are really pulling a very pitiful face.  What has become of all your gaiety.  It is all very well for you to talk, replied the bear, a furious beast with staring eyes is in redskin house, and we can;t drive him out.  The bee said, bear I pity you, I am a poor weak creature whom you would not turn aside to look at, but still, I believe, I can help you.  She flew into the fox cave, lighted on the goat smoothly-shorn head, and stung her so violently, that she sprang up, crying meh, meh, and ran forth into the world as if mad, and to this hour no one knows where she has gone.
